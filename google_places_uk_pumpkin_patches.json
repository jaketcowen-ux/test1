The strawberry picking is super accessible for all ages and wheel chair friendly and you don’t need to lean over /crouch to pick the strawberries. The customer service here is amazing and so welcoming! The strawberries are THE best that I have EVER had, literally tastes like honey and so juicy! The breakfast we had today was amazing (halloumi slice) . The coffee is also great (I love my flat whites and it was done properly ) . We also had the ice cream last time and my family loved it, again no exaggeration one of the best ice creams! Lel served us today at breakfast and she was so lovely! Everyone was so polite at the restaurant. I would definitely come here again, we have officially become regulars! My family came all the way from roundhay (they can’t wait to come again) and we came from garforth. It’s worth the visit!!",

Nice walks around the displays, with plenty of those all important photo moments to take advantage of, these not overly busy due to the well though our set up.\nWe went with our 3 year old, who enjoyed the many colours of tulips, the ice cream and the feature photo areas.\nWe will visit again potentially for pumpkin season or Christmas!\nHighly recommend!!!",

The staff were welcoming, and while it wasn’t as packed with activities as during their big seasonal events like Halloween or Christmas, the slower pace was actually a plus for us—it made the whole visit more calm and enjoyable.\n\nIt’s a great spot for family photos if you’re into rustic backdrops, and there are lots of little corners and farm features that make for really cute shots.",

In nearly two decades, nothing—and I mean nothing—seems to have been updated or improved. For a place that prides itself on being a family attraction, it feels more like a business stuck in time.\n\nLet’s start with the maze. This year it was downright appalling. Instead of being surrounded by healthy, tall corn, I found myself wading through more weeds than anything else. The whole thing looked neglected, like no care had gone into it at all. To make matters worse, the boards you’re supposed to find were plastered with so many stickers you couldn’t even see what they were meant to show. It completely ruins the experience—how on earth are kids supposed to get any fun or challenge out of it when some parents can’t be bothered to teach their kids basic respect, and the farm itself can’t be bothered to maintain things properly?\n\nYes, the playground is still decent and the kids enjoyed it, but after 18 years I would expect to see some improvements, upgrades, something to show that Cairnie is actually reinvesting into the place. Instead, it feels tired, dated, and in desperate need of a shake-up.\n\nCairnie has so much potential, but right now it’s letting itself—and its long-time visitors—down badly. After all these years, I shouldn’t be leaving feeling more disappointed than when I arrived.",

We booked our slots online the night before, but I’d definitely recommend booking in advance—especially if you’re going in a group—so you can get multiple slots together.\n\nEach picking slot costs £5.59, plus a small booking fee. The process was easy, and the experience was absolutely worth it.\n\nThe strawberries were plentiful, ripe, and BIG—many of them that perfect deep red you hope for. The properly red ones were sweet and delicious—exactly what you want from fresh, local fruit. They provide a small box to collect your berries, which isn’t weighed. But if you ask for an extra box, it will be weighed and priced separately.\n\nAside from strawberries, there were also raspberries, blackberries, and a few other types of berries available for picking, depending on the season. It’s great to see that kind of variety.\n\nThe farm also has a shop with fresh farm food and quality vegetables and fruit for sale—definitely worth a browse after your picking session.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful experience—fun for all ages and a great way to enjoy the outdoors with friends and family. Highly recommend it if you’re in or around Warrington!",

A lovely lady from the farm shared so much interesting information about its history, explaining how they used to plant pumpkins and how modern machinery has changed things. She also detailed how pumpkins grow and how long it takes before they're ready to pick.\nWhat made it even better, especially for kids, were the illustrations she used to support her explanations – my 5-year-old was captivated! He absolutely loved it.\nAs part of the experience, we also got to plant a sunflower seed to take home, which was such a nice touch. My boy is diligently taking care of it and can't wait for it to blossom!\n\nWe got incredibly lucky at the end of our pumpkin planting session; they had an unexpected surplus of strawberries and offered us the chance to go strawberry picking. While this experience was a bit more expensive than I'd ideally have liked, it was still such a wonderful spontaneous activity for the family. And seriously, these were the most beautiful strawberries I've ever seen!\n\nKenyon Hall Farm is clearly beautifully maintained and offers so much. I'd wholeheartedly recommend booking an adventure there – it's a fantastic day out for the whole family.",

It’s the perfect place to enjoy a mix of fresh air, local produce, and family-friendly activities. The farm shop is packed with seasonal fruit and vegetables, homemade treats, jams, and even fresh buttermilk. We also spotted grapefruits, leafy greens, and other farm-fresh produce, which makes it a fantastic spot for anyone who values quality and locally sourced food.\n\nWe spent time in the pick-your-own fields, which was such a fun experience for both adults and children. Depending on the season, you can pick strawberries, raspberries, pumpkins and more, and it’s a really hands-on way to enjoy the farm. The staff were welcoming and helpful, explaining how everything works, and the fields were clean and well organised.\n\nThe café is also worth a visit, we enjoyed freshly baked cakes with coffee, and there are plenty of light bites, sandwiches, and hot meals to choose from. Everything tasted fresh and was reasonably priced for the quality.\n\nWhat makes Kenyon Hall Farm so special is how relaxing and inviting it feels. There’s plenty of safe space for children to play, and it’s such a refreshing escape from city life. Whether you’re stopping by for the farm shop, the café, or a family day in the fields, it’s the kind of place you’ll want to return to again and again as the seasons change.",

We even saw a lamb being born. Thanks again for a lovely stay and we are already looking forward to coming back in the summer. :)",

There are many free activities for the children to explore.. large hay bales, colouring area, make your own badge, photo props (so many and decorative displays). The marshmallow roasting was £2.50 and the quad pods were £3. It's really affordable to take part in the extras. During the ASN session, it's really peaceful (less people). No loud sounds, some extra activities are closed like the canon. Which is great for us.\nPerfect family halloween day out. Best pumpkin patch near us! 🎃 🖤",

On arrival we found check in and parking very easy.\n\nThere were lots of portaloos available which is handy for young children and plenty of food stalls. Admittedly the price of everything was on the steep side with medium chrurros costing £7 and large £7.50.\n\nThere was plenty of free activities, the play barn, colouring, and more. There are also paid activities like the cannon and the bouncy castles, again it's a lot if you have a few kids with you.\n\nThe field of pumpkin was huge and there were loads of fun signs about to take pictures at.

The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the visit even more enjoyable.\n\nThe outdoor seating area overlooks a beautiful green field, creating a peaceful atmosphere that really connects you with nature. We ordered the Chicken Club Sandwich with a salad and the soup of the day both were absolutely delicious! The portions were enough for two adults and a child. It cost us £21, which we felt was great value for the quality and quantity.\n\nThe shop itself was lovely, offering a wide variety of products. Everything felt thoughtfully curated and fresh. Another great bonus is the free car parking, which makes visiting even more convenient.\n\nIf there’s one suggestion I’d make, it would be to add a small playground area for children that would make it even more family-friendly. Overall, Maxey’s is well worth the visit great food, great service, and a charming environment. Highly recommended!",

Meal was very small and clearly skimping on things like cheese but topping up on cheaper products like salad. Overall the meal was bland,  tasteless  and lacking portions to call it a meal, a starter at best. Staff are polite but clearly are under pressure to rush around to the point of losing that personal interaction with customers. Well if finished eating now and feel the need to go home to have something to eat... that's not good. Going to pop in the shop to pick up a cake which are lovely.",

Firstly I had booked the wrong day but sent an email and the staff were amazing, I got a quick response and they sorted it out for me which I massively appreciated. I booked to go to the family fun day then to go to the barn soft play afterwards. We paid per child for the family fun day which was £10.99 per child and £1.00 per adult which for what you get i think is amazing. Two hour slots, and once you get in everything was free except a hook a duck which was £5 but it was win every time and that's always a saviour for me personally,  no disapointed children. Inside there were bouncy castles, instable slides, outdoor games, fair rides etc which were also free i though this was amazig. Usually you pay to get in to somewhere then have to spend a fortune in there, so amazing value for money. There was also a more quiet section which really suited my son as he has SEN and there was a sand pit and obstacles. Everything was so clean and staff were really friendly and ready to help where needed. Inside there is a restaurant, the play barn and a farm shop. We booked separately into the play barn which again was a two hour slot it was really big and had loads for the kids to do to keep them entertained the full 2 hours. There was alot an outdoor play area attached and a cafe that served food and drink which was reasonably priced. We of course visited the farm shop on our way out to try some cheescake and other sweet treats which were absolutely delicious. It was a but for us to travel but I can say for sure this will be somewhere we return to.",

I liked that there were enough buggies and 2 sizes available. The larger one was able to sit 2 children as well as bags and pumpkins. The 3 year old enjoyed being pushed and pulling his selection of pumpkins.\nWellies are recommended. We took a packed lunch. However, there are refreshments available. The shop inside had a lovely variety of Halloween decor and treats to purchase. Will definitely visit again.",

          "text": "First time visiting this year and did really enjoy this patch. Lots of different variety of pumpkin to choose from compared to other patches we’ve visited. Was quite busy and muddy so it’s a good idea to bring wellingtons. Plenty to see and appreciated all the different displays, one walkthrough which is completely dark and has clowns so be wary if you have young children but great that they separated this part off! Our pumpkin was big and only £5 which was good value. Toilets on site and plenty of picture opportunities. Some negative points would be the dramatic parking stewards who were shouting at people to park in the lines. We parked further up away from all of this and coped perfectly fine by ourselves finding a space. The next point is it all felt very money grabbing, there was a small selection of rides but £4 each for the bumper cars?? Absolutely ridiculous and we was shocked by the coffee prices £4 for a cappuccino!! We ended up leaving it as never heard of coffee so expensive! The Halloween shop had a lovely selection but the wreath we picked up was £55 and the signs all scattered round the shop saying ‘ANYTHING BROKEN MUST BE PAID FOR’ was not necessary, I was scared to touch anything! Lastly the woman at the check out who had dark short hair with glasses was very rude and needs a lesson in customer service. She spoke to my partner in a condescending and passive aggressive tone when all he simply asked was how much the pumpkin was. Such a shame as she ruined it for us.",

We went there end of June. It’s perfect time for Cherry and strawberry picking! Sweet and juicy! They provide you a box for pick up and you can check out while you approach the exit! There is a big garden shop selling all related garden products and plants. The cafe inside the shop is amazing! After a sunny day it’s super nice to enjoy an ice coffee/ smoothie or tasty ice cream Sunday!! Remember to book your ticket in advance. Price is calculated on how much you pick.

This year (2023) was not worth it, there was just nothing interesting, a complete lack of stuff to look at compared to previous years. I would visit if it was just the parking you pay but that’s as far as we go now. £20 entry to see…nothing, dunno where all that money they are given goes and far less than last year. Big entry fee then to pay for the pumpkins etc just a shame really. Will be visiting else where now. Still nice to do once",

I like feeding animals because it is very therapeutic. My husband comes with me 🙂\n\nThe place is not very big but it has a lot there. The space has been well thought out. There are a lot of play areas for the kids. There is a barrel ride - first time I have seen anything like that at one of these places. On the 'not seen it before' trail. I have never seen sheep racing. It is a short course and 2 x per day they race 4 difference sheep. So funny.\n\nAnimal feeding - the layout is circular which makes it nice and easy. All animals were very friendly.  They have 2 barns one has chicks in and the other has rabbits and guinea-pigs. You can go and sit in either barn and hold the animal for as long as you like. No queuing for a 2 minute hold and moving on. Never seen a set up like this before and think it's awesome.\n\nA great day spent recharging batteries by feeding and cuddling animals.\n\nOnly negative is the cafe seemed a little over priced. They do have picnic tables if ya want to take ya own food though.",

The setup is well executed and all the staff are very very friendly. There were just too many pumpkins to choose from and the variety in shape and colour was amazing. Not sure who was more excited, me or our 3 year old. The price of the pumpkins are very reasonable, so much so we asked to round up our payment. Please dont think you're going to get Tesco prices, these pumpkins are far superior and the cost keeps these places going so you can have the experience. The stalls are worth a visit. I had the best pork pie I've ever had and the lady was so engaging with our little boy. The bakery stall serves delicious sweet treats which we indulged in. Overall, a brilliant morning spent getting muddy with plenty smiles. You have to give it a go and we will 100% be back next year!",

(Nothing else needs to be said)\n\nWe decided to have a day out at this farm as it was local to us, had lambs and there was a feeding session, I had no idea it was going to be so great.\n\nUpon arrival we met the Farmers at the coffee station, they were extremely friendly and told us all about the farm. We bought coffee’s and animal food.\n\nOnce inside there is a lovely play area with seats to sit and watch your children. There are so many animals to see, my children were thrilled to be able to feed the animals too.\n\nFacilities around the farm are very good with hand washing stations, toilets and a couple of play areas.\n\nThe lamb feeding session was the highlight of our trip and my two girls were chatting about it non-stop on the way home. Izzy and her assistant were so knowledgeable about the lambs, explaining where they are from and what will happen to them when they grow. They went through what would happen step by step. They not only fed the lambs but made their very own bottle up and go to handle the lambs at the end.\n\nThis is probably one of the best animal experiences we have had. We will definitely be back.\n\nYou can see how hard the staff have worked to get the farm open and how well the animals are looked after too.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Five stars from us! The Hill family from Leeds.",

It's an extra £3 on top of general admission, and well worth it. You can hold and stroke the lambs after feeding and it was absolutely amazing! Everyone there loved it. We bought some feed afterwards for the goats who are a comical and greedy bunch! The van where you pay also serves drinks and snacks, and there is seating outside. Since we last visited, there is a younger child's play area. Can't wait to go back!",

The farm is well-kept and full of charm, and the animals are all very gentle and friendly — perfect for children to interact with. From calves and lambs to many other farm animals, you can really enjoy close-up encounters and even watch the process of milk production, which was fascinating to see.\n\nThere are plenty of activities for children and families, and feeding the animals is made easy with affordable feed available on-site. It’s both fun and educational, giving kids the chance to experience farm life in an authentic and enjoyable way.\n\nOne of the highlights for us was trying the farm’s own freshly made yogurt — it was absolutely delicious and highly recommended!\n\nOverall, it’s a fantastic place for a family day out, especially with young children. Warm atmosphere, well-cared-for animals, and plenty to see and do — we’ll definitely be coming back again.",

The farm is very family-friendly, with plenty to do—you can easily spend a couple of hours there exploring. There’s a wide range of animals to see and interact with, and they also offer donkey and tractor rides for an additional cost. These were really popular, so expect a bit of a queue, especially on busy days.\n\nBooking is online only, which helps manage entry but doesn’t necessarily ease the crowds on public holidays. Throughout the day, there are several pet shows which are fun for both kids and adults. Each paying visitor gets a feed bag to interact with the animals, which adds to the hands-on experience.\n\nThe farm is well-staffed and really well maintained. There are multiple cafés and ice cream huts dotted around the site for when you need a break or a sweet treat. Near the entrance, there’s a farm shop that sells their own fresh flavoured milks, regular milk, cheesecakes, butter, and local honey—all farm-produced and worth checking out.\n\nI’ll definitely be visiting again, though probably not on a public holiday next time—it was packed! That said, it’s a brilliant day out for families and animal lovers alike.",

We all loved it. Staff are friendly. The lemon drizzle style ice cream was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS 😋 The chips are delightful. The shop was great. But the highlight for us all was all the fabulous animals. Piglets, chickens, sheep, meerkats, alpacas, Guinea pigs, reptiles, cows, goats, reindeer. I could go on and on. The animal feed was cheap and loved by the sheep and cows.\nI was disappointed that we couldn’t get closer to the animals but it was still a fantastic day and I didn’t want it to end.\nThe paths are well maintained. The animals look so happy and well looked after.\nI was sad to leave, especially as we’d not seen farmer Dave or Rob, but maybe next time as I will be back.",

And you can feed reindeer, and various other larger animals. We also got to handle the owls when we were there, which was a nice thing to be able to do.\n\nThere is plenty to do to fill a whole day, the cafe is reasonably priced and the food, while we didn't buy anything as we had our own picnic, looked great.

Every time I go, I make sure to stop at the farm restaurant for lunch—it’s honestly one of the best parts. Their beef burgers are amazing (I ordered them both times), super juicy and flavorful.\n\nThe orange juice is also a must-try. It’s so sweet and refreshing, without any sourness at all. We liked it so much that we bought a whole bottle on our first visit. Sadly, the machine was broken last time, so we couldn’t get another one.\n\nGetting there is a little tricky if you don’t drive. The bus drops you off about a 15-minute walk away, and when we tried calling an Uber to head back to the city, no drivers were available even after waiting 20 minutes. So just keep that in mind.\n\nOther than that, everything about this place is perfect—I’ll definitely be back!",

Highland cows on the walk up to were a great addition. Only negative I would point out is the price of the food. I understand food and drinks are always more expensive in these places but £8 for a basic roll with 2 thin sausages and £12 for a burger with 1 slice of cheese on a bun with no other toppings is extortionate and there really is no justification in charging that. I would recommend taking your own food and drinks to avoid being robbed when you’re there . Otherwise a lovely morning out enjoying the views.",

I love how the equipment suits different ages/stages. I also love getting to see the baby animals and it was so fun feeding the lambs and the piglets that are there just now are so cute! The animals all look happy and have plenty of space. My little one also loves the soft play area indoors and playing with the toys and books while we wait for food. Food is also great!\nThe only constructive thing I’d suggest is a wee update on the toys indoors. Great dolls house but no dolls.

Picnic area and lots of animals to meet. They also have a small shop which was such good value. Thanks so much for a good experience! We also managed to get a pram around too with our 11month old.

It’s not a huge place, so we spent about an hour there, but the experience was totally worth it.

The staff were great, were very friendly and engaging. The girls enjoyed talking with a gentlemen that happily answered all their questions about the chicks and the various animals within the park. They have a great set up with picnic benches where we had a bit of lunch in between activities.Will make a point of coming back.",

The atmosphere created by the staff was really good, especially the people working at the pumpkin kiosk on the field. All the props and food areas were decorated with great imagination but at the same time kept the farm vibes.\nThe conditions were challenging if you were one of the unfortunate few who had forgotten your wellies. My kids absolutely loved the mud and the challenges it presented us.\nThe cafe had a pizza stall and served goods that are made at the farm, milkshakes, etc. The coffee was good, and the price was what I would expect to pay at a family attraction like this.

Staff were polite but did not seem to have the right training.\n\nWe were given an old menu so we ordered the lamb main and got given the lamb starter. If the staff member had noticed this when we ordered then it would have avoided the issue of the wrong dish being served. We then had to wait for a new main course for my husband which didn't come until after I'd finished my food. Staff could have managed this better and offered for both dishes to come out at the same time or for him to have the starter whilst he was waiting. Condiments were also not offered though they did have a good selection of Stokes sauces.\n\nWould definitely visit again though as the farm shop and outdoor area were nice too.",

We brought cheesecake, mayo and bacon jam.

Bought some meats that we didn’t actually need from the shop to justify the stop and usage of loo, then wanted to walk for a few mins so the two dogs that had been in the car for several hours could stretch their legs. Literally two minutes is all we needed for the dogs and said to the woman who approached us. Incredibly rude woman effectively marched us back to the car. There is a way to approach and speak to customers that doesn’t necessitate being so impolite. I was stunned. Then to add insult to the experience, got home to find the sausages I’d bought were significantly out of date - almost 3 weeks. They were partially frozen which I was confused at, but now makes sense. See photo. There are no words really except avoid. Thankfully found a much more welcoming spot a little further up the road.",

Then we were allowed to have a lamb on our lap and lastly led through to wash our hands in their newly constructed wash area. A lovely experience and a great price too. Totally recommend it.",

          "text": "I had a wonderful morning at Berry Hill Farm Gwent. A new lamb had just been born as we got there and we watched as the mama sheep cleaned her baby and bonded in her gentle way of nudging and talking to her child. It was just wonderful to see and the guys and girls at the farm explained all about the process and the markings on the sheep. One of the new mamas had triplets and she was fetched up to them in her pen quite content.\nAfter all the health and safety hygiene protocols was gone through to protect both animals and people from germs, the friendly folk allowed us into the feeding pen. We sat on bales of hay while the babies were released and they were so excited and came straight up to seek a feeding bottle. We sat for about an hour feeding and playing with the lambs who all had different personalities and markings. Dave and Dotty for me stole the show and Spike and Gizmo made sure to greet everyone. A lovely experience for adults and children, we were allowed to hold the lambs and children were picking up their favourites for cuddles. After an hour the lambs needed their naps ready for their next feeding. The farm is easy to find, has parking is well maintained and run by a lively family who really care for their animals and land. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and highly recommend a visit.",

It was incredibly well organised, all the guys running it were incredibly friendly with the kids and it was a really fairly priced experience. There were about twenty lambs running around, everyone fed a lamb and then there were loads of chances for cuddles and photos. Not rushed at all.\n\nI’d advise everyone to make hay in the dark shop afterwards. We bought some gorgeous eggs, bacon, sausages and a couple of heavenly T-bone steaks.",

The tractor ride was fair, meeting Santa was nice, but it fell down on the lack of staff and the play area lacked magic. It was more about waiting around to see Santa. After seeing him, we were moved to the farm bit where there was no staff at all, just very jumpy goats and sheep. For the price, not really worth it. We have been to far better farm experiences. In fairness, the appalling weather didn’t help. Wouldn’t recommend",

The frustration didn’t stop there though as I waited to be able to pay whilst the 4 young women seemed more keen to discuss who was doing (or not doing) what. In fact, they were so distracted, I thought that I could easily walk out without them noticing!!! I wonder how many customers do just that?!

People who run it are super friendly, they also have lovely farm produce from local Bee's (the honey is amazing) fresh rescue chicken eggs, reindeer, pigs, a couple of geese and some cows. You can go and get a freshly made cup of coffee and some homemade cake after you've gathered your pumpkins and sit and enjoy it. Fab few hours spent there, would definitely reccomend a visit.",

Although I have to say we had no issue with them but what happened is exactly why large groups shouldn’t be allowed on campsites.\nMusic was being played long after the 10.30 curfew and the owner eventually confronted the large group of around 30 guests. And what ensued was upsetting for my family. Shouting, swearing and threats of violence from the guests and the site owner.\nIf handled differently there could have easily been a peaceful outcome.\nOnce we could see the large party was staying for the Saturday night I removed my child from the situation and made the 90 minute journey back home.\n\nSuch a shame as upon arrival it looked a perfect site.",

She gave us a guided tour of the farm and was super fun and engaging, with a great knowledge on all the animals. The kids were so entertained. The farm has so many excellent resources for kids - play parks, sand pit, tractor rides, barrel rides, a foam party, jumping pillows, a magical fairyland forest and jurassic park walk - PLUS so many adorable animals.\n\nWe went back to the party room after meeting loads of the animals and had hot food served for the kids. The food was delicious. We had sandwiches and gourmet Sausage rolls served for the parents and everyone commented on how beautiful the food was.\n\nFrom start to finish every single guest spoke about the friendly staff.\n\nStress free, family vibe and well organised - great place for a kids party. We will be back",

There are farm animals to see around the place, a big sandpit with toys (which gets sauna hot on a warm day), pet zoo with another soft play area and a few toys, pedal go-carts, cafe and picnic areas. We booked the earliest available soft play 9:30 slot, my toddler then took a nap in the pram and then we spent the rest of the day playing around. We left around 4pm. Fantastic day, will be definitely coming back. I must say the staff is really friendly, especially the guy working at the pet zoo.",

Yet, toilets were cleaned regularly, staff was working very hard on making sure that each visitor looked after. Time tables with day events like bottle feeding and petting animals were clearly displayed and we were able to find it easy . We also appreciated that staff was knowledgeable and knew some interesting facts about animals they were showing. Like snakes and tortoises.\nThe park is kept tidy and clean, you could spot the staff picking up rubbish and ensuring all is in good order.\nDefinitely a highly recommended location, if you are lucky with the weather, this is a deffo a full day attraction.\nFinally, on site there is a bistro restaurant where you can buy some burgers and nuggets , ice creams and similar items at not too exaggerated prices.and they actually taste not bad.

Fulton pumpkin patch is an actual patch where they grow the pumpkins and they are still on the pumpkin plant which was what I was expecting here aswell a few scare crows in the corn maze would’ve made a great difference. Overall not satisfied with the experience for the price",

Absolutely huge, like butter to carve thankfully.\nDid not get to experience the food tent as was a little busy for us at the time - no complaints though, maybe next time!",

At the forest school, the activities are planned to a high standard, everything is well prepared, organised and pitched at the appropriate level for group.

Our first impression was very positive; the spacious and well-maintained grounds created a peaceful atmosphere.\nAs mentioned frequently in the reviews, the ice creams at the farm were truly fantastic. We had a hard time choosing from the wide variety of flavors, but each one we tried was delicious. The small playground for children was a big plus for families. While the kids played safely, we were able to relax and enjoy our time.\nThe farm also offers the opportunity to pick your own fruits and vegetables. I picked sweet corn, and its freshness and taste were simply amazing. This experience is both enjoyable and educational for those who love being close to nature.\nOverall, we were very satisfied with our visit to the farm and are definitely considering going back. It’s a great escape for both children and adults. If you’re looking for a peaceful, nature-filled, and delicious day out, I highly recommend visiting this farm.\n\nThanks,\nAdem",

But I put in the effort and tried because it was so well done, the announcement did go on for like 20 mins but that's only because they wanted to make sure the early arrives weren't bored while we waited for the gates to open and more people to get their wrist bands, so I completely understand, kept us entertained anyway!\n\nThe food stalls were divine, smelt incredible too!\n\nThe amount of thought, effort and time put into this event was definitely shown through in everyday and I absolutely CANNOT  fault a thing! I think, it was the best day out I've ever had with my family!\n\nYou should be so proud of your achievements, and also, you should be doing many many many more events, seasonal ones!",

My only downside was the lack of seating at the top of the field for those of us with older legs & poor mobility, but the owner is looking into it.\nCosts £3 to get in and £1 per bloom, which I think is reasonable as you don't have to pick anything if you don't want. There are also gladioli this summer.\nIt's just nice to get out in real countryside & just enjoy yourself.\nHave been before & will go again.",

There was a nice hay bale play area for children to play in with bouncy horses which brought them much delight!\n\nThe sunflower field itself was stunning! It is a much longer walk around than it looks due to a wildflower add on at the top and the gradient of the field, but manageable.\n\nI was so impressed how many sunflowers there still were when we went at the end of the season and got some beautiful bundles of flowers!",

Fields were full of massive strawberries all ripe,we filled so many punnets, enjoyed the wild flowers field as well and you get vouchers for all your tickets that you can use when buying your strawberries.

We did visit quite late in the season this year though so they only had a handful of tabletops strawberries open, which was disappointing as we enjoyed picking them from the ground last year and they didn't have that this year. I will say as well that the strawberries weren't as sweet as last year, we found them quite sour and tarte.\n\nThey had a jumping pillow which was great, but it was really quiet, no tractor rides etc. They do have a new play area and inside they have a sandpit and some tractors to play on so that was good, just wish we went earlier in the year, especially to pick some raspberries!\n\nWe will still come back next year!",

This was our first time participating in such an activity, and it was so good.\n\nThe farm is conveniently located just a fifteen-minute drive from Sale, making it easily accessible.\n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted with ample parking and friendly staff who assisted us in finding a convenient spot, despite the chilly outdoor conditions.\n\nThe tractor ride to the farm was a delightful addition, allowing us to enjoy the scenic views of horses, goats, hens, and cows along the way.\n\nThe farm itself is beautifully decorated, featuring numerous photo opportunities, picnic benches, and a food area offering a variety of items such as hot dogs, bacon rolls, and even a drinks cart. I particularly enjoyed a delicious pumpkin spiced latte topped with whipped cream and pumpkin sweet—it was a highlight for me.\n\nThere was an impressive selection of pumpkins, showcasing various colors, shapes, and sizes that I had not anticipated. My friend initially thought we might overspend, but to our surprise, all the pumpkins we selected totaled under £20, which was remarkable.\n\nWe also enjoyed food and explored a maize maze, collecting clues to solve a puzzle along the way.\n\nAs we wrapped up our visit, the staff kindly transported our pumpkins back to the car park via tractor.\n\nOverall, we had an excellent time, and I look forward to returning next year!",

We loved the tractor ride to the patch and the maize labyrinth, which adds a playful element for the kids.\n\nWhile the pumpkins were smaller and there seemed to be fewer compared to our previous visit, it was still enjoyable to pick our own. The admission fee of £4 per adult and £3 per child is reasonable, but I think it would be great if they added a few more activities or touches to make it feel like a fuller experience, especially considering how magical it felt the first time.\n\nAll in all, it’s a nice way to spend a day with family, and with a bit more variety, it could become a truly standout event each year!",

The toilet facilities, the rusty old tractor the kids could play on and the very bumpy tractor ride. I went with the kids just to keep them safe but wished I hadn't as it was very uncomfortable. The strawberries were fabulous and the flowers looked great too. This place had a lot to offer, it just needs a few tweaks to reach it's full potential.",

Plenty of parking and plenty to do before choosing our pumpkins (of which there were plenty to pick)  there were pumpkins in the field, in crates, in boxes just laying about, all sizes though the huge ones had all been sold by the time we went there.\nMy partner read about it being really muddy and not good for pushchairs so we didn't take ours for our 10 month old and had to carry her round but found it wasn't too bad and definitely not too muddy for pushchairs as the put walkways down.\nPlenty of activities for the kids, couple of places to get food and even a mobile bar for people to grab a pint etc.\nThere was even a ghost \"bus\" ters bus as a haunted house (or bus) for the kids to go in.\nWill definitely be taking the pushchair next year.",

We went at 3 pm which appeared a good time to go, busy but not too busy. Plenty of time to see everything. Food and drink available to buy at an extra cost. My children loved picking their pumpkins, so many different kinds to pick from. Lots for the children to do. A maze, bales to climb on, graveyard, pumpkin shooter, craft activities, and a area if you wish to carve your pumpkins. Plenty of car parking, which was free. We went on a lovely sunny day but would recommend wellies if the weather was rainy. Pumpkins I felt were fairly priced. They range from £1 to £10. Only suggestion it would have been nice to have the pricing guide to see how costly your pumpkin was before the tills. I would recommend visiting.",

Good variety as well, we brought home some orange, green, white, and grey pumpkins of varying sizes.

Yes it’s Pumpkin time again..and If you have never had the pleasure of picking your owen giant globes straight from the farmers field then get yourself down to Beluncle Farm in Rochester, Kent. This for me is essentially the best way to swing into Autumn, a sunny afternoon in fields ablaze with fiery coloured fruits is sure to lift anyone’s spirits. Whether you want an afternoon out with the kids, a Jack O lantern or two or just a good laugh in the dirt with your friends then PYO Pumpkins will not disappoint.  This family run business is in its 15th year of pick your own pumpkins, so it’s was one of the first farms in the South East to start this Halloween tradition and it’s simple: just book a online slot, turn up, grab a barrow and enter the fields of joy. The pumpkins and squash are grown in rows acording to variety, and you pick them right from the soil where they are grown, you don’t get anymore down to earth than that. Special Varieties include: the salmon pink ‘Porcelain Doll’, ‘Jarrahdale’ a slate grey chunky beast of a fruit and ‘Over the Moon’, which was almost glowing in the fields in all its neon yellow glory. The fantastic French heirloom variety ‘Galeux D'Eysines’ and of course there’s thousands orange and white ones suitable for carving too. And what’s more, the staff are super friendly and the prices great, so don’t delay, get yourselves glowing today.",

All of the pumpkins 🎃 (excluding decorative) are edible 😋a far bigger variety than at the supermarket. They have about 30-40 varieties.\nThe later in the 2 week picking season you go the further you need to walk. There are crates of pre-collected pumpkins and all pumpkins are already off the vine. You may need boots in rainy weather warning some varieties are a tad prickly bring gloves.\nOne down side is that there is no indication where to go for specific pumpkins.\nThis is Wheelchair accessible however as it is a working farm, it is not bump free and verges are grassed. The further you go the more difficult it is to get to. I would however recommend a power chair self propelled will be more of a challenge.\nThe aforementioned crates are good for picking. I am sure the friendly staff will help where possible.\nThe pumpkin shop is a nice little stop for pumpkin decorating items and carving sets. (If you are carving your pumpkin be sure to save the flesh to make some yummy pumpkin soup, pie, cake.... Don't waste such great produce) The pumpkin chutney is great and worth getting a couple of jars.\n[We did not try the burger van]\nLooking forward to next year's event",

Lovely shop, and wow the cakes looked absolutely delicious.  I was nearly put off coming by the moany reviews but I needn't have been.  Some people are just moany and yes, the place is clearly a money pit but if you just stick to picking fruit and maybe a cuppa and cake then what's not to love?!  We sat on a picnic table outside in the sun and ate half the strawberries before we left - so nice.  Only deducted a star because there is no clear signage/ instructions on what to do/where to go for fruit picking so you are wandering about following giant strawberry signs and hoping that's it and there will be punnets for you (there was).  Also no clear pricing for £ per kg. But overall a lovely time spent,  and we will definitely return when back in the area.",

My iced coffee had no coffee in it and this was not acknowledged or rectified satisfactorily. It would have been more appropriate to make a new one but instead I paid £5 for half a cup of cold milk with added coffee.

The environment was calm, welcoming, and thoughtfully set up — perfect for little ones who may get overwhelmed easily.\n\nStaff were incredibly kind and patient, giving us the space to explore while being nearby if we needed anything. The animals were gentle and well cared for, and there were lots of opportunities for hands-on interaction, which my daughter loved.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was how sensory-friendly the whole place felt — not too noisy, not too busy, and plenty of room to move around. My daughter felt comfortable enough to engage, and it was so heartwarming to see her smiling and enjoying herself so freely.\n\nFinlay’s Farm is a hidden gem for families looking for a relaxed, inclusive day out.

I think the fact it’s free is absolutely amazing, as a lot of pumpkin patches so charge an entrance free and although this often includes a free pumpkin we normally only pick one for the kids to take home. We picked up three pumpkins two big and one small and only spent £7.50 which I think is a bargain.\nThey also have a spooky trail which was free to join in and the prize was a glamping break and a little bit of fun for the kids as you go around\nOverall really pleased and will definitely return.\n\nOnly negative I will say is the little gift shop was expensive and didn’t have any prices advertised so I would ask the prices beforehand but otherwise amazing day out.",

The grounds were pristine, the air was crisp, and the colours of autumn were stunning. Here’s why this visit deserves a five-star shout-out:\n\nThe staff greeted us with big smiles and were incredibly friendly. They could not have done more for us during our visit, they were very approachable and friendly, nothing was too much.\n\nThere were several charming backdrops—rustic fences, sunlit pumpkin patches, that made our photos look like postcard material.\n\nOur visit well-paced and reasonably priced. We felt like we got a full, authentic day of fun without any pressure or overcrowding.\n\nWould highly recommend visiting this pumpkin farm in this season. It’s a heartwarming, photo-ready, family-friendly destination that leaves you with a big grin and a bucket full of memories—and pumpkins. We’ll be back next year for sure!",

The range of soft play was great especially as we had children ranging from 3-11 years old in our party. Not a huge amount of animals to see- would be even better if there was a small animal area to pet rabbits etc. The outside play areas were great and even though it was busy there was lots of space etc. My daughter got bitten quite badly on the hand by one of the ponies but a member of staff carried out first aid and completed an accident form. The animals are very used to being fed so if you don't have food they think you are the carrot!!",

Clean & plenty to do. Lots of animals and a huge indoor play centre that looked great so you can spend the whole day to get value for money.\n\nMy little boy is almost 3 and loved it, we’ll definitely be back.\n\nThe coffee and cake(s) were lovely, we also bought a few bits from the farm shop on the way out. I really appreciate local goods being sold so that was great as I didn’t know there was a farm shop. I’d seen comments that the food there is expensive, but personally didn’t think it was too bad when looking at the menu while getting coffee. Maybe not as cheap as some play centres but I can’t comment more as we didn’t buy them.\nPicnics are allowed on picnic benches outside and not in the cafe area.\n\nAlso thanks to the social media team, I messaged the evening before to ask what sort of food is served as I couldn’t see anything online and had an informative reply quickly even though it was out of typical office hours.\n\nWe bought tickets in advance as it was Easter weekend so thought that would be best. There were some Easter activities going on which was lovely too.\n\nThere are additional costs for the train ride and a few other things but the train was only £3 per person which if you have a little one that likes trains isn’t too bad. You can purchase tickets online with your entry, at the entrance and at the train station before getting on (card accepted).",

We had the most amazing stay in one of their pods that was self-contained in its own private space with its own wood fired hot tub and bbq. The views from there, and actually everywhere on the farm, are stunning. The beds were so comfortable and spacious, and we had everything we needed.\nThe horse riding was incredible. We were allowed to groom and tack our ponies in the morning before heading out with our group.  Our guide took us up into the valleys and hills, allowing the group to go at a faster pace when the terrain allowed and if we were comfortable with it. The horses go  up and down some really rough terrain in places with ease. We stopped for lunch midway through the day where we were provided with a delicious packed lunch freshly made, and the horses had time with their bridles off.\nAll in all, the most incredible hands-on riding experience we could have wished for, all made that much better experience because of the fabulous staff who work in every part of the park. We loved it from the moment we arrived, to the time we left.",

What an amazing time we had from start to finish , we were quite nervous at the start especially myself as I hadn’t been on a horse for awhile due to having a double hip replacement, this didn’t phase our instructor who was amazing she talked us through every step of the trek and was so patient and kind to myself and my daughter!

You can tell it's a working farm as you drive in there are beautiful fruit trees in autumnal colours. The pumpkins are grown there in the field and there's usually a trailer and hay bales to explore. All different types of pumpkins and gourds and they really know their crop- always get good advice on preparation and cooking. The kids love it and it's a good place to spend a couple of hours letting them do their thing, as the carpark is far from the field, good visibility for letting them explore free range.",

On weekdays they mainly serve sandwiches and sausage rolls, whereas on the weekend the full menu. Which wasn't an issue at all. We enjoyed delicious homemade milkshakes, coffees, sandwiches, and sausage rolls which were all absolutely incredible and reasonably priced! The weather was glorious so we spent some time basking in the sun, while my little boy made a friend and were running and playing in the fields in our eyeline.\nWe headed out to the picking fields, full of choice fruits, veggies and flowers. We did take our pushchair for our baby who was a bit sleepy at this point, which wasn't an issue, but if you can avoid I probably would for space.\nAfter fruit picking, we headed to the shop to pay for our goods and were so impressed with the shop offerings and made some impromptu purchases.\nAll staff we encountered were super friendly, helpful and smiling.\nWhat a lovely place!",

The staff are exceptionally welcoming, and the service is outstanding. It is somewhat expensive, but the quality justifies the higher prices. I do wish they offered a greater selection of locally sourced products and foods.\n\nI plan to continue shopping here, especially because I'm particularly fond of the peanut butter machine, it's a highlight for me. I would definitely rate this place 10 out of 10. The only drawback is its remote location, making it quite a journey to reach since it's quite literally in the middle of nowhere. However, the trip is worthwhile for anyone looking to source top-notch ingredients for cooking or baking and to explore the farm and make it a day out.",

My little cousins enjoyed climbing up and down it.\n\nThere's also a little house if you keep walking right after you enter. There are 2 swings that my cousins enjoyed bumping into each other. There's also an adorable fairy walk. It's a wee path where you can see a bunch of fairy statues and houses as well as big ladybugs.\n\nThere are animals you can pet as well but when we went they stayed in a corner away from everyone, I think they were tired.

The weather was perfect and everything felt very relaxed and family friendly from the moment we got there.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were told it’s cheaper to book tickets online, so we did. We were also given some animal feed, which the kids really enjoyed using. The park wasn’t too big or too busy, which was great because it meant the kids didn’t have to walk too far and it was easy to keep track of them.\n\nAt the rabbit meet and greet, only two rabbits were out but it was really hot so that’s totally understandable. There were loads of hand washing stations around which was great after feeding and petting the animals.\n\nThe sand/beach play area was really nice and the kids loved it. There was also a big cafe with plenty of shaded seating which was perfect for taking a break and cooling down. Parking was easy too with lots of space.\n\nOverall it was a lovely day out and perfect for younger kids. We’ll definitely go again.",

Perfect age appropriate playground, the sand pit is great, the free carousel, cuddle time with rabbits and opportunities to feed the animals. Tractor ride was nice but a bit boring...not many animals to see just empty fields. A number of extras like the rides that you have to pay a few quid each for which are a bit of a bane in my eyes. Was pretty astounded by the price to join in the bottle feeding of the lambs which was £8. Considering my daughter has just done this twice at another farm for no extra cost I was pretty shocked. As I said if I had have paid anymore than £12.95 for myself and daughter I might have been a bit less pleased but considering that included a tub of animal food usually £2.50...and an Easter hunt with small chocolate at the end of it was all worth it.\nAlso very impressed by the cleanliness and tidiness of the whole farm.\nIt could have done with a few more schedule boards and better signage.",

At first I thought there was a few animals and a soft play centre and that's it but there was a massive playground with a few rides, zip wires and a decent sized sand pit. There's something for kids of all ages. I was skeptical beforehand as it's £10 per person including children but it was worth the money. The only downside was the highchairs weren't clean. I will be returning again at some point.",

After a lot of research we ended up looking round our local garden centre for ideas. Rob and co really went above and beyond with their customer service. They talked us through the whole process and discussed our options in great detail and made recommendations of what would work in our garden and what wouldn’t work. After agreeing what we needed all the product came the following week. When we put down all the soil we quickly realised we hadn’t bought enough soil so immediately ordered 4 more ton. Rob understood our needs and delivered it the same day which was amazing and enabled us to crack on with it. Overall we were very happy with the product supplied and the customer service we received. The photos attached to the review were from when the turf and soil were delivered, after 12 ton of soil was put down, once the turf was put down, 3 1/2 weeks after laying and after the first cut. We are very happy the way it’s turned out.",

It was easy to find, there is plenty of parking, and it's cheap to go into the play areas (£11.99 per child and £2.99 per adult). I didn't see any disabled spaces, but there are no parking bays so you can leave a space next to the car for wheelchairs/pushchairs access. The car parking areas are well maintained, but are grass/dirt which might not be suitable for all wheelchairs. We went when it was really busy (hot day in the summer holidays) and it wasn't too busy. There are lots of well maintained paths around making it easy to navigate with disability aids (I myself use a stick and had no issues). There is a reasonably priced cafe, farm shop and concessions stand as well. You can also bring a picnic and there are plenty of benches/tables around to eat at! There are also lots of benches/seats in and around the play areas so it's easy to keep an eye on the kids and not have to be too far away. There are various types of play. areas for kids from toddlers to older kids.\nMy son is 5 and he had a brilliant day! The staff around the farm are really friendly, and they look after the grounds so well with regular bin emptying, litter picking and tidying. Well worth the low cost to get in! We will definitely be visiting again!\nYou can buy animal feed for £1 per bag at the entrance (reasonable bag size for the low price) to feed various farm animals on the way round. There are goats, ducks, geese, Free-roaming chickens, cows, horses, and pigs. Overall, I would easily give the farm 5 stars. It is a wonderful place to visit with the kids to get them off their tablets/devices and get them outdoors!",

These pumpkins are not bought in the local supermarket and thrown in a field (yes it happens). No, these are grown with care. Cut straight off the vine and excellently presented. There is a real rustic homely feel as you scour the field for your favourite pumpkin of choice. All sorts of shades of colours and sizes and for a very reasonable price. There are plenty of wheel barrows for the in demand pumpkins and even smaller ones available for children. At weekends there is a catering van and some small rides. Accessible toilets and a big car park, it can get muddy so wellies a must. The best thing this year is the tractor ride through the pumpkin patch and the Gruffalo themed section of the tour.

It’s such a lovely way to spend a morning, wandering through the fields with a basket and selecting your own fruit straight from the plants.\nAlongside the fruit picking, the farm also has a fantastic farm shop that is well worth a visit. It’s full of fresh local produce, ranging from high-quality butcher’s meats to homemade cakes, wines, and other delicious treats. There’s always something tempting to take home, and the variety means there’s something for everyone. One of our firm favourites has to be the fresh cream cakes, which are consistently excellent and feel like a real indulgence.\nThe farm also has a café on-site, which always looks inviting, although I have not tried it myself. Judging by the quality of everything else at Essington, I imagine it’s just as good as the shop. The whole place has a welcoming, relaxed feel to it, and it’s a lovely spot for families, couples, or anyone looking for a peaceful outing.",

The downside are the prices are  quite  expensive, but then it's to be expected tbh  as almost everything is noticeably superior to what you would buy from a supermarket, especially meat, bread and fruit n veg. There is also a nice restaurant/cafe which is similar, great food but quite expensive.",

Well priced refreshments and the pumpkins themselves are reasonable. £3 for a small, £6 for a medium, £9 for large.

This year it's in a different field due to works being carried out in the other. We were directed well to park the car. They had laid a temporary track on top of the grass to combat vehicles being stuck in the mud. Worked well. We weren't told where to go once out of the vehicle so followed the perimeter round and found it without too much fuss. Walk past the bouncy castle slides and trampoline bounce with ropes and you come to a large selection of wheel barrows and the entrance. Plenty of pumpkins to choose from. Couldn't find one small pumpkin, let alone 2, so we opted for one medium sized at £6! Most, if not all the pumpkins, had been placed in the field. I did find some gourds which looked to be growing. Very muddy, wear wellingtons! Kids really enjoyed pushing the wheel barrows which got stuck in the mud a few times! The kids enjoyed exploring all the spooktacular props and hunting for the golden gourds - didn't find a golden one this year! They had goats this year, you could pay £1 for some feed. They had a small fire to toast marshmallows and a couple of other things. They had bouncy Castle slides, trampoline bounce with ropes, food and drink stalls. Plenty to see and do there including pumpkin carving! With no entry fee, you don't mind paying £3 for a small, £6 for a medium or £ for a large pumpkin. We went last year, couldn't wait to go again this year and will probably go back next year so all in all I highly recommend it!",

Really nice that there is the covered barn option as well as the outdoor patch. Small farm shop on site had some nice little bits of stock.

Staff were all extremely friendly and eager to help/chat, and the place just had a very warm atmosphere (despite it being mid-October). Pumpkin patch (new this year) was more find-your-own than a traditional patch as they'd been moved to a dedicated space, but said area featured theming and even a lovely bit of pumpkin art.\n\nThe perfect tonic to a lot of the more excessive setups in the area.

The reptile talk show was good, the three hosting it were very nice and informative about the reptiles. The small animals were very cute, especially the ducklings. You can ask to pet the small animals such as the rabbits. The soft play is HUGE and so, so fun, it was in very clean and well kept condition, even the role play area seemed clean. There is a couple of good drop slides, the 2 in the drop slide area and one in the soft play. They have some other shows and experiences on, but we didn't attend those. Some very small areas were closed off as there was renovations going on there (or what seemed to be).\n\nHoping to come back soon to do their new maze, well worth the money. The onsite food places seemed reasonable priced, my partner had a brownie which he said was delicious. We did take our own food, but did get some snacks and drinks from there. Lovely little gift shop on the way out too.",

You can also see Guinea pigs, rabbits etc which are in hutches. There are some sheep and goats in a separate enclosure, which you can feed also. Staff are friendly and very helpful, but most of the time it seems to be un maned. Remember it's a charity and not for profit farm. Enjoy!",

We arrived around 10 o’clock and did the soft play for 2 hours first which was amazing! It consistent of a bouncy pillow, mini golf and even a ninja warrior area!\nWe headed into the farm after this. We left around 4 o’clock in the afternoon so we had a really lovely day.  My children loved stroking the baby chickens and really enjoyed the tractor ride. We took our own pack lunch but the menu in the soft play looked really good. Lots to choose from, I thought there was something for everyone. Health and safety is also on point here too which is good.\n\nWhat I will say is to be very weary of other people. There was a group of disabled people on a day out with carers and one of the guys was extremely abusive towards me and called me horrible names Infront of the my children. Using words I would never personally use. There was no staff on hand to intervene and his carer just stood there. I felt really uncomfortable. It ruined my whole day truthfully and I wouldn’t be in a rush to return even though it was a good day out.",

From the very beginning, Charlotte and Jason were amazing. Nothing was too much trouble, and they were so helpful in bringing our vision to life (the disco ball was a brilliant touch!).\nThey gave us loads of time to decorate, which made the lead-up stress-free and relaxed. On the day, they ran everything like clockwork – we didn’t have to think about a single logistical detail. It all flowed perfectly around us, allowing us to just enjoy the day.\nThe venue itself is a dream: beautiful fields filled with flowers for photos, plenty of outdoor space to enjoy the sunshine, and great indoor areas just in case the weather doesn’t cooperate. We loved how much personality we could inject into the day – and Charlotte and Jason had loads of fun, creative ideas to elevate the experience. One of our favourites was the band making a surprise grand entrance and leading everyone into the hidden party room!\nTransport back to Leeds was easy to organise for guests too, which made the day even smoother.\nIf you’re looking for a wedding venue that’s beautiful, flexible, and fun – we couldn’t recommend Bert’s Barrow enough!!",

From the moment we first saw the venue, we knew it was the perfect place for our big day. We got married on the lawn in the sunshine with the beautiful view, ate in the corn store with the gorgeous fairy light wall backdrop, and partied in the bunting barn with a band and dance floor. The separate barns work so well for that reason and the setting is stunning.\n\nCharlotte and Jason are the loveliest, most accommodating and hardworking people. They truly went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly and we really did have the best day ever. We went with most of the recommended suppliers which was great as it all worked so seamlessly. We felt completely at ease throughout the planning process and on the day of the wedding.\n\nOur guests couldn’t stop telling us what a perfect day it was. We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect place to get married. Highly recommend!",

It's a great way to introduce children to the importance of respecting animals and how important our farmers are, as this is a working farm.\nAt the gift shop, you can buy cartons of cut carrots to feed the animals as you walk around (if you do this, make sure you save a few pieces for the llamas, goats, donkeys and ponies near the end of the walk round). There is a family-friendly cafe with a few great lunch options, and as we were leaving, we saw a notice for dog training classes.

We couldn’t find a flowering sunflower anywhere.  I returned to the kiosk to ask the person who had taken the entry fee if any sunflowers were actually ready and where I might find them, to which I got “dunno.”   When I expressed my confusion over having paid £15 when the product wasn’t even ready, I just got a rude shrug and he walked off.  I left empty handed.  Do not waste your money, what a dishonest rip off.",

There is also a great area for kids, with a sand patch and haystacks for climbing as well a climbing frame and tractor. For the adults there is a small cafe serving tea and cakes. Would definitely recommend and if you’ve got kids you can easily spend a couple of hours",

We had a play in the park, walked around the sunflower maze where my son helped pick me out some lovely sunflowers. 🌻\n\nHighly recommend for families as it was fantastic value for money at £10 per family and you get to take home 6 sunflowers.\n\nOne of our favourite parts of the day was all the bees and butterflies we saw while in the field.\n\nThey have a cafe for snacks and drinks, as well as a pick your own potato patch. We took home a bag for Sunday lunch 🤣",

Not only was there a piano in a midst of a sea of sunflowers but a huge swing and other surprises as  we wandered around the fields. As well as being able to pick pumpkins and magnificent sunflowers, there were lots of activities for children. The greatest fun was the tractor experience, firing water guns at Halloween Targets. What a marvellous idea this is and one that the family can enjoy together.  Quality refreshments were available and the Brownies and Pizza were delicious. Pumpkin Patch at Bewholme you have provided a lovely, outdoor  experience for families to enjoy that is environmentally friendly with not a piece of plastic nor tacky rubbish insight. I hope this venture is a huge success for you because you throughly deserve it. Thank you for providing such a well planned, fun experience.",

In fact it was large slides that had age restriction of 5 years + and a sand play area/ tractor driving pit.\n\nWe would have preferred more for littlies to do especially when paying £17 for admission of a over 1 year old. If there is age restrictions on majority of rides like 3+ i think it would be better that under 3's go free. As there isnt much as stated he could do.\n\nHowever the fairy/ troll walk, farm animal barn walk through & maze were attractions we were able to do and as for play areas, he could go on the small climbing house, mini trampoline and push about tractors.

You can buy a variety of fresh fruit, veg & eggs m from the payment area. There’s a little cafe but is a little expensive. It cost us £8.50 for 2 small punnets, 3 sunflowers & a bunch of wildflowers.

Great food, great fireworks, theres a little bonfire people can get close to, to keep warm and then a BIG bonfire too. There are beautifully decorated tents if you want to hide from the weather and tuck into the food which is offered inside the tents. The Hot dogs were lovely, great selection of food including burgers pulled pork sandwhiches, soup, chocolate apples, chocolate, brownies and more plus coffee, tea, hot chocolate and a range of beer. It was really muddy this year due the to the weather. This cannot be helped but my little girls absolutely loved this, they jumped and slided in the mud and had a great time, so it just goes to show whatever the weather kids can have great fun so if you're going to come next year I'd say bring wellies and good over alls and a family can have a great night of fun, whatever the weather ❤ thank you for a spectacular bonfire night. We will be here again next year.",

For something a bit more mentally stimulating, the maze is a great option. It’s entertaining and a little tricky — you might find yourself going in circles, but that’s part of the fun!\n\nUnfortunately, we didn’t have time to explore everything, so we may plan a return trip.\n\nThe car park is large, but given the popularity of the attraction, it’s wise to book in advance (there’s also a discounted rate if you arrive after 2 PM).

Even our very energetic 4-year-old with ADHD was totally worn out by the end of the day... which, trust me, is nothing short of a miracle!\n\nThe weather was glorious, which made the experience even better. The staff were so friendly and helpful throughout the park, and the food was absolutely delicious – a pleasant surprise for a family attraction! Everything was also really reasonably priced, which made the day feel even more enjoyable without worrying about breaking the bank.\n\nFrom the adventure playgrounds to the enchanted forest and everything in between, it was a magical day for all of us.

Strawberry and raspberry however is priced around 7.5 and 10.50 £ per kilo. Inside there is a small park for kids and a cafe for sandwiches, coffee and ice cream.\n\nThey also do various other events as well throughout the year. Example: Tulips, turkey and pumpkin picking.

Staff were super friendly and helpful advice for going round.\nKids loved the indoor playground and there is a little outdoor bit as well.

If the cost was lower for adults I believe more would be spent in the cafe for the adults as it is a lovely space for both kids and adults to go, safe and adventurous play for the kids and comfortable area with good food for adults to converse.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend to any of my family and friends to visit.",

          "text": "Alright, buckle up, buttercups, for a review of Conifox Adventure Park – a place that promises endless fun and delivers... well, mostly.\n\nWe arrived, brimming with the kind of optimism only parents armed with caffeine can muster. And fair play, the place has it all! You can run wild like a sugar-crazed squirrel, tackle obstacle courses that make you question your life choices, zip around on go-karts (because what's an adventure without a mild risk of whiplash?), and generally exhaust your offspring into a blissful, silent coma. Plus, there's an indoor play area, which is perfect for when the Scottish weather inevitably decides to reenact a scene from The Perfect Storm.\n\nNow, here's where my eyebrows did a little dance of surprise, and not the good kind. It turns out, \"adventure\" at Conifox comes with a side of \"separate billing.\" You want to hit the outdoor thrills and let the little darlings loose in the indoor soft play? That'll be two separate transactions, please! My wallet felt like it had just completed its own obstacle course, and the finish line was a rather deflated sense of \"did we really just spend that much?\" for a day out. It felt a tad on the expensive side when you tallied up both tickets.\n\nBUT! (And this is a big, glorious 'but')... the saving grace, the true hidden gem, the sprinkle of magic dust on this slightly pricey confection? Adults are allowed to play too! Oh, the unbridled joy! Watching my kids' faces as I belly-flopped down the slides, got tangled in the netting, and (unintentionally) wiped out another parent on the go-karts was worth every penny. It added a whole new layer of hilarity and slightly embarrassing parental participation that genuinely elevated the fun. Nothing quite says \"quality family time\" like seeing your dad get stuck in a tunnel meant for toddlers.\n\nAnd finally, a tradition as old as time itself at these sorts of places: the food and drink. Prepare to take out a small, secured loan. The prices here are more ambitious than my attempts to look graceful on the climbing frame. My advice? Pack a picnic, smuggle in some snacks, and maybe bring a hip flask of moral support.\n\nConifox is a blast, especially if you embrace your inner child and get stuck in. Just be prepared for the dual pricing structure to hit your bank account like a rogue go-kart, and plan your refreshments strategy like a military operation. You'll leave tired, happy, and slightly poorer, but with some genuinely funny memories.",

Tucked away beneath the Market Street arches, this immersive bar transforms its theme every few months, drawing inspiration from iconic franchises like Game of Thrones, Jurassic Park, and Stranger Things. The attention to detail is incredible from the décor to the drink names and flavours, every element is crafted with care and a deep love for fandom. The cocktails are as imaginative as they are delicious, with bold flavour combinations and stunning presentation. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate, adding to the overall experience with great recommendations and explanations. While the space is small and booking ahead is advised, the atmosphere is vibrant, the service outstanding, and the concept totally unique. It’s far more than just a cocktail bar, it’s a themed experience that keeps you coming back every time the menu changes.",

The right-hand part of the cafe, heading towards the outdoor garden centre, is the dog friendly section, identified by markers on the windows and on the tables.  There is table service here, unlike most other Dobbies.  We were all made very welcome, including the four-legged friends.\n\nFor lunch we chose the Cumberland Sausage and Mash, with Red-onion Gravy, and the Mac and Cheese.\nI traditionally expect Cumberland to be a long, curly sausage, but the description of \"3 sausages\" implied otherwise. It was served with seasonal veg, which was cooked relatively soft.  The gravy was nicely sweet and the sausages were tasty with slightly crispy skins.  I am told the Mac and Cheese was very cheesy on top.\n\nIn all, it was delicious comfort food, just what was called for as a travelling lunch on a cold day. My expectations for a high-class restaurant would have been much higher, but for a pub/garden centre lunch it really doesn't get much better than this.",

Many tables had not been cleared or cleaned, which gives a poor impression of service quality, and one result was that there were no clean trays available. There was a growing queue and only one person serving and taking money. This was painfully slow and we gave up and left. There were at least 7 or 8 customers joined the queue behind us (3 in from) by that time. Staff seemed lackadaisical and uninterested. Clearly short staffed that day.

There was a selection of food and drink vans with undercover seating area.  The seating area filled up very quickly though and was very noisy with all the children being excited.  Food and drink wasn’t really much more expensive than you’d pay on high street.\n\nHaunted Trail was a bit of a disappointment and we felt that it could have been so much more fun.  There wasn’t anything really apart from some sheets handing as ghosts until you got to the cauldron area for buying marshmallows to toast.\n\nPumpkin patch had a huge selection of pumpkins to choose from all ready to be picked up.  There were the usual people watching their children kicking and stomping on pumpkins (really disrespectful in my opinion) but apart from that was good fun choosing which pumpkins you wanted to take home. Pumpkins cost a lot more than they would in the supermarket but you need to keep in mind it was only £7 to get entry for the car.\n\nThere was a maize maze as well but we didn’t go into that area.\n\nThe waiting area for dogs wasn’t enclosed so I was a bit unsure how dogs could be left there.\n\nOverall a good day.",

The disabled toilet facilities are dirty and seem to not be checked throughout the day. The disabled toilets would benefit from a key system as the toilets are clearly abused.\n\nThe food venues around the site had a good selection however the prices are very high and most of the venues went out of stock shortly after 12.\n\nDespite the poor facilities for my visit there is lots going on throughout the day for children, if it was more accessible 4 stars would be given.",

Normally in zoos you get the feeling that the animals don't have much room, or place to roam and genuinely feel sorry for them but here you have such a feeling of happiness for them, they have so much room to walk around, enrichment to play with and look so happy and healthy! Not only that, the talks and experiences they have whilst there are so lovely, they tell you so much about each animal, show you their way of feeding them, and get to know each animal on a personal level. The play centre for children is lovely too, really inclusive of all ages.\nThe cafe their was amazing! Yes prices are a little more than your average cafe prices but I think its so so worth it. The food was absolutely perfect and is the quality you would find in an upmarket place. Definitely go!",

Went to sit outside, there were lots of empty tables with the numbers on! They just needed collecting.\n\nTried a couple of tables, all quite dirty/messy. When they brought our drinks out, they struggled to find us because they’d given multiple people the same colour cup! Again, they simply needed to collect the table numbers! Considering they weren’t even busy, I would expect more.\n\nAfter 40+ minutes, our food came out, we were waving but they struggled to find us (because of the multiple cups the same colour!). Our food was placed on the table and then we were told they were out of certain items so had replaced them with others (without checking with us!). We were asked if it was ok but we’d waited 40 minutes and cleaned the table the best we could so just ate the food we were given (a cooked breakfast with 4 hash browns, an extra tomato (not even vine tomatoes as menu stated), and a “bigger portion” of beans to replace the missing items!). It’s quite poor that we weren’t told that items were out of stock when ordering, and that they didn’t even check with us for alternatives during the 40 minute wait.\nFurther to this, the eggs were cold, the beans were cold, the rest was barely warm with the exception of the very hot hash browns. With a 40+ minute wait for the food, we expected the food to be hot (and as ordered!).\n\nWe live local and it’s the first time we’ve popped in after driving past multiple times a week. We don’t think we’ll be back because we were quite disappointed. The location is nice and the sausages are tasty but not much else going for it! As you can see from the photo, we were served quite a sad looking breakfast really (that was cold too)!",

The pricing was excellent especially the fact that parents get in for free, even though several were enjoying the play area too. :) It does say you can't bring your own food, but that didn't appear to be enforced, the cafe was reasonably priced as well though.

I also like that you can easily set 'holidays' in the account when you don't need the box.\n\nI initially chose this service because they offer veg boxes without potatoes (which I don't eat). We always add a few one-off items to each box, e.g. milk, fresh eggs and seasonal fruit and it has greatly reduced our need to shop plastic-wrapped, bland-tasting produce from the supermarkets.

The whole Park feels very fresh and clean and there are lots more attractions than I remember. The soft play and slides are very well maintained And thoroughly enjoyed by all the children. The farm zoo has lots of animals and you can buy feed for them. We went on the train ride and tractor ride both included in the price. I was particularly impressed with the crazy golf. The sculptures of the octopus and whale were very impressive and you could see a lot of love had gone into creating this attraction. We had a late lunch in the restaurant which was very tasty and good value. The farm shop is well stocked and has a lovely butchers. It would definitely come again.",

The car park is huge and completely free which makes things so much easier and stress free. Once inside there is so much to do for all ages. My personal favourite was the water bumper ride which had me laughing and getting soaked in the best way possible. I could have stayed on it all afternoon. I also loved feeding the animals. They are clearly well cared for and very friendly. There are goats alpacas sheep and many more and you can get up close which is such a fun experience.\n\nThe indoor play area is massive and full of activities to keep children entertained for hours. Outside there are brilliant adventure playgrounds climbing frames and open spaces to run around. The tractor rides and the little train are perfect for taking a break while still enjoying the park. There is also a lovely café that serves tasty and reasonably priced food and drinks which is perfect for a pit stop. Everywhere is clean and well looked after and the staff are friendly and helpful.\n\nPuxton Park is one of those places where time flies because there is so much to see and do. Whether you are visiting with family friends or just want a fun day surrounded by animals and activities it is worth every penny. I am already looking forward to going back and enjoying it all over again.",

There’s paddle boats, train, high ropes (and smaller one for littler children), and huge soft play, and lots more too. We spent the whole day interacting with animals and playing.

Our favourite experience is Vita Nova although this year X4 came close as they improved it this year by casting you into darkness with only a glowstick to light your way. We eneded up arriving after our intake time due to a medical emergency but the staff were und and we were still allowed in :). Do recommend catching the two shows available too, they always have extra scares and pretty lights to see.",

Food was great but not cheap but it was on a par with what you expect at these events now; around £13 for a \"messy mac\" ( mac n cheese with toppings) but the portion was a good size.

Tickets we're 12.50 pp, 5 of us went, it included a sunflower trail, walk around the Jurrasic jungle which had jungle animals and dinosaurs hiding in the corn crops, a small train ride, game of golf and a game in the wet section, each person got a water gun and it's every person for themselves, be prepared to get soaked! There were 2 big inflatables which were free, a small fair ground, ££ for each ride. A food van, a bar(alcohol is served) slushie and doughnut van, game of hook a duck and a game of throw the ball in the milk urn, which of course was ££. I spent £53, 3 children on 3 rides, £5pp bungy jump, £3pp run away train, bumper cars £4 per car upto 2 people per car, a game of hook each a duck £5pp we purchased some mini doughnuts  10 for £6, slushes were £3pp (Nan brought). We did however take a picnic and there were several benches to sit at, just beware of a few wasps, plenty of bins for rubbish, a few portaloo's that were clean, had plenty of toilet roll and hand sanitiser, we had our own hand wipes too, 1 was for disabled access, I think I saw baby changing facilities in one, but didn't take that much notice (sorry). Overall it was a great day out, kids had a lot of fun. I would definitely go back. We did go last year when they had a Halloween fair on, despite the muddy conditions that was good also. Hope this helps.",

Very confusing, there are more funfair rides than anything else.\n\nThe water fun, was the highlight but if it was a cold day there wouldn't have been much to do.\n\nThe golf was easy family fun minus some bumpy joints...The train journey was nice minus the uneven grounding.\n\nThere was a lack of excitement for kids, please look into this.\n\n1. More Farm animals... chickens? Cows? More than One sheep? Horses? No feeding capacity for the animals\n2. More actual things to do rather bouncing Castle, water fun and safari golf",

The chips from the food van was also good and fresh with plenty of ketchup. Trick or treat street was also good as my daughter got to knock on all the doors and received a fair amount of sweets and they had great props throughout! I’m glad we visited on a quiet day as reading other reviews this would have been extremely busy in peak times. The farm was very well decorated for the Halloween vibe with massive props everywhere and plenty of photo opportunities, my daughter did have a really good time here but I can see that older kids would probably not enjoy it as much.

          "text": "We were looking forward to enjoying Sunday lunch here, particularly given the charming setting next to the farm shop. Unfortunately, our experience was extremely disappointing.\n\nUpon arrival, we were surprised to find the dining area uncomfortably cold. The gentleman who served us (presumably the manager or owner) was notably brusque and dismissive throughout our visit. Shortly after being seated, we were immediately asked for our order, with little opportunity to even greet the rest of our family. When we politely requested a few minutes to review the menu, the response was curt and unwelcoming.\n\nMy mother, who is vegetarian, asked whether it would be possible to have the Sunday roast with the meat served separately, as she wished to enjoy the vegetables while allowing the rest of us to share the meat. This seemed a reasonable request, yet it was met with confusion and made her feel uncomfortable.\n\nSimilarly, when I enquired about a children’s menu, I was abruptly told that it consisted only of half portions. As nothing on the menu suited my daughter, I asked whether we could order a separate portion of cauliflower cheese for her. The response “it will be a very big portion” was unnecessarily sharp, although my daughter did in fact enjoy and finish it.\n\nWhile the meat was of good quality, the remainder of the meal was substandard. The roast potatoes were overcooked and floury, the parsnip lacked flavour, the Yorkshire pudding was dry and cold, and a simple request for mayonnaise was never fulfilled.\n\nIt is rare that I feel compelled to write such a review, but the unwelcoming service overshadowed the entire experience. Having travelled nearly an hour for what we hoped would be an enjoyable family meal, we left feeling uncomfortable and disappointed. Regrettably, we would not consider returning.",

A tractor ride that literally drives around the outside of a field - with nothing to see or spot along the way.\n\nIf you want to go on the (few very old and very tired rides and inflatables, I’d say maybe 5 total) it’s an extra £6 each!! We’re literally talking about a few tiny bouncy castles suitable for a 5 year old and a little merry go round again aimed at toddlers.\n\nThere is an inflatable dome with a few Halloween movable statues (like a werewolf that turns its head, that sort of thing) which you can go in for free, but it’s not even decorated, literally just a few of the things you’d see in the range stood up around the outside.\n\nPumpkins - you can choose a pumpkin (small, medium or large) off the shelf and pay additionally for them if you choose. We didn’t - it is not pumpkin picking at all, literally just pick one up like in Asda.\n\nThen there’s about 6 stalls with people selling stuff like bath bombs, an ice cream van, a hook a duck (dreadful £ shop prizes for £5 fee) oh and a pair of donkeys, alpacas and sheep you can feed with a £2 bag of food.\n\nThis is for sure the Halloween equivalent of the Willy wonka mishap and we would not recommend.

The café has a warm, welcoming atmosphere, and the staff were friendly.\n\nThe farm shop itself is a treasure trove of local produce and indulgent treats.

It’s always been my favourite craft store in town, and this summer I decided to join their sewing classes with Dai. I can't praise the experience enough. We've made two pieces so far (the tote bag and the dress) and Dai has been an incredible teacher throughout. He's knowledgeable, receptive, and always made sure to bring my ideas to life (I love my dress!). His patience, diligence, and down-to-earth personality make him one of the best teachers I’ve ever had. Not only did I learn how to use a sewing machine, but I also gained skills like amending clothes, understanding how garments are made, cut, and assembled—really diving into the science behind sewing. Beyond sewing, Dai offered advice on other interests of mine and even general life wisdom. Sundays quickly became my favourite day of the week thanks to him. These classes weren't just about learning to sew, they created a sense of community. It felt like being part of a friends’ book club or a social group, and I left every class feeling like I truly got my money’s worth.\n\nSarah, the store owner, is also always so friendly and helpful, creating a welcoming space where you feel comfortable from the moment you walk in. She offers support and valuable advice on ongoing projects (crochet for me).\n\nSo, if you're looking for a welcoming place to spend your time, even if you're not into sewing perse, I would highly recommend these classes. They made my summer, and they’ll give you so much more than just masterful sewing skills.",

Yes it’s a lot but she had so much fun so we didn’t mind. It’s her birthday party at the weekend, they’ll last until then and at least we’ve got plenty of strawberries to go around… wrong.\n\nWe got home and immediately put them in the fridge. In less than 24 hours the entire basket was mushy and mouldy and every single strawberry has had to be thrown away.\n\nMy daughter was so upset this morning when she asked her strawberries and there’s not one that I can feed her. It’s also incredibly disappointing after spending so much money. We only wanted them to last three days, but they didn’t even last 24 hours.",

Happily ever after.\"\n\nWe love this farm and try to go annually to support our local farm. We enjoy eating the pumpkins too. The piano outside was a happy addition and my son took to playing it, despite the missing central keys, beautifully. My daughter also enjoyed the bumpy tractor ride. We focused on picking smaller pumpkins of different colours, getting a few sunflowers and a purple cauliflower which we'd never tried before.\n\nI can honestly say in the last week we've had roasted pumpkin, double chocolate pumpkin muffins, pumpkin pancakes, pumpkin spiced latte, pumpkin spaghetti, pumpkin soup and pie and we're still not sick of it! It's so yummy and versatile in recipes. Only negative is that the drinks and food on premises is quite expensive; my children shared a milkshake which was £5 (about the size of a Starbucks cold coffee).  Between the entry fee £3pp, drinks, and our pumpkins, we spent around £30.\n\nIn any event, we're supporting a 4th generation family business with organic products and will be going again!",

Then turning in, seeing the doors open to a winter wonderland of decorations and trees was brilliant!\n\nHad a nose around the ornaments first, and couldn't resist picking a few up to give them a new home.\n\nFinally started looking for trees, and explained to the lady the height, shape, and bushiness that I was after. She picked out a tree, opened it up, and it was absolutely perfect! Exactly what I was looking for.\n\nI asked if they'd chop a little off the base, and while I waited for the chainsaw to arrive was offered a free mince pie which was a lovely touch.\n\nFinally, on the way out we mistook some mud for a path, and got the car stuck. Oops! However they were very helpful, getting the tractor out to pull us out of the mud so we could be on our way.\n\nA fabulous spot, and one I'll head back to next year for another tree for sure!",

The farm is well-organised and very welcoming. As soon as we arrived, we felt happy and excited to start picking.\n\nThe strawberry fields were full of fresh, juicy strawberries, and we had so much fun walking through the rows, choosing the ripest ones. The strawberries were sweet, delicious, and far better than anything from the supermarket. It felt great to pick them with our own hands and enjoy them straight from the plant.\n\nThe staff were friendly and helpful, and the overall environment was clean and family-friendly. We also loved seeing other people enjoying the place – kids, couples, and groups of friends all having a good time. There’s something satisfying and joyful about picking your own fruit in such a lovely setting.\n\nAfter picking, we relaxed and took some nice photos to remember the day. It was truly a refreshing and enjoyable experience, and we definitely plan to come back again soon.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fun and fresh outdoor activity, we highly recommend visiting Vale Pick Your Own!",

They had a cute little face painting area and shop you could purchase things. We got sweet treats, a little pumpkin beret and spooky matching earrings for me and my daughter. We had some amazing Greek food and my daughter wanted to pick up every single pumpkin she seen🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ The pumpkins are reasonably priced, we got 10 (all different shapes and sizes) for £25.

Fun activities have been designed around the year for each. For Halloween, the hidden gem is a double treat of the maize maze and pumpkin picking from the patch.\n\nThe pumpkin patch is free to enter, but the maize maze costs about £8 per person.  The maize maze offers a Halloween themed mysterious murder walk in the maize field. Clues are scattered all over and provide just the right incentive for the whole family to log some calorie burning steps. The pumpkin patch is gorgeous and expansive. There are varieties of pumpkins to choose from and lots of Halloween themed setups for photo opportunities.\n\nAlthough it was wet and soggy, we enjoyed every bit of the experience.\n\nP.S. There is a coffee shop on site and a fire pit for the kids to flame some marshmallows. Card and cash accepted. Free parking and porta loos, too. No dogs allowed!\n\n5/5 any day!",

It's never felt like 'education' hence the quote marks. The range of topics, the depths, the variety of methods has been brilliant. it was always good but has improved in our 5ish years with PP.\nThe environment is attractive, well maintained. Stimulating but with space to breath too. The environment has also been continually improved over the years.\nThe emphasis on being outdoors is great.\nThe communication system is now fantastic. easy to use, not clunky, covers messages, invoices, food intake and updates on the learning and fun stuff.\nThe communication form the team throughout the pandemic from the early days was exactly what I hoped for. Quick but without jumping to answers when there were none at first. Honest about the options and clear when they had to advise things that might have been tricky (but were clearly fair and the best that could be offered).\nI have really missed being able to go in to the nursery during the pandemic, It was always so lovely to see.\nThoroughly recommend.",

But when it came to the animals, there wasn't a lot there. We liked feeding the pigs and the goats. The mini play houses were basic . It was very busy when we went. Much busier than I was expecting. We had 2 OAP's a carer and a disability with us but there were no concessions for them. It was hard to get round in places with the wheel chair too. They had pumpkin carving (pumpkin was a paid added extra) and Halloween pictures to do. They put in a lot of effort for the event . But that didn't make it worth what we paid. We only lasted about an hour and the girls were ready to come home.",

We also enjoyed looking around. Not only was there a pumpkin patch but areas where there were things to do for the children including art supplies. Different types of food and drinks. Me and my nephew happily tucked into a cookie. I would recommend and would be returning next year. All the people who were in charge were polite and happy to help.",

I love that it's one of the only pumpkin patches where you don't feel like you're being extorted for money at every turn! We spent nearly 3 hours at the patch with friends, 8 kids from age 10-4 & they all loved it and look forward to it each year. They loved the wand making this year especially but as usual the bales/slides and train ride were a big hit to o & then onto the patch for the scavenger hunt and to pick our pumpkins. All the family/staff you come across are lovely. We'll be back again next year!",

The patch has moved this year to another field opposite (I loved talking to the owner and hearing about how they rotate to help the fields) and it felt spacious and there was so much to do. They still have the barrel ride which is a favourite with our children and once you’ve paid your entry fee you get a brilliant craft area, mud kitchen and play area for the kids, including a scavenger hunt in the patch. The selection of pumpkins they have grown is VAST and there are so many different varieties to choose from. It doesn’t feel cramped which is good. You can tell this place is run and planned by people with families because it’s really kid-friendly with so much to do and also with an eco-friendly eye. Each year they seem to be investing a little more into the patch and there is always something added each year to bring a bit of interest. Love it.",

There is plenty of fun for them there including games which really help with their coordination and development such as the duck race - my daughter LOVED filling her bucket and emptying it on the ramp to make the duck move! Mini maize maze is perfect for little legs and the PYO wildflowers is a no brainer - bargain bunch of flowers, photo opportunity & fun activity. What’s not to love. Toilet facilities on site with picnic areas to bring own food and despite there being lots of wasps this time of year, the facilities are actively doing all they can to minimise this.\nAlso LOVE that this small business supports other small businesses in way of local caterer and food supplier, photographers for mini shoots and so on.

We are aware of the signs not to walk on the lavender - what’s not clear by this is that you can apparently only walk up 2 wide paths through the patch. My friend and I were taking some photos amongst the lavender on the narrow walk ways between, being very respectful and careful not to walk on the lavender. We were inspired by the photos shared on Facebook publicising the fields, and were disappointed when staff told us to move  so we weren’t able to continue taking some lovely photos. What made this even more sour was that there were many other people doing what we were, the staff saw this but did not ask them to move. So if you’re inspired by the photos used to advertise the lavender field, then you may be disappointed and told off if you try to do this.",

Even my father enjoyed them and he's not a huge fan of them.\nThe jam was also so tasty and I have had it on my toast every morning since purchased.\nI will be definitely returning and they also have raspberries and later in the season,  Runner beans and Broad beans.",

We picked out 7 pumpkins priced at £1.50 each and 2 pumpkins at £2.50 each. However, when we went to pay, the attendant charged us £19.50. I initially questioned the total, but he insisted it was correct, even though he acknowledged the individual prices.\n\nNot wanting to make a fuss, I assumed I might have miscalculated. After leaving, I added it up and realised the total should have been £15.50. When I returned to the entrance to address the issue, the staff were unhelpful and dismissed my concern, saying the attendant has been doing this for four years—as if that meant he couldn't possibly make a mistake.\n\nWhile the outing was enjoyable, the overcharge and the dismissive attitude of the staff left a sour taste.",

We enjoyed a wonderful few hours here with friends and family.\n\nParking was easy, the queue to get in with our car wasn't long at all. All of the staff we met were very friendly and helpful. Everyone seemed happy to be there which is such a rare thing to come across these days! The staff who were dressed up as characters were brilliant with the children. Our daughter's loved meeting the witches especially!\n\nThe pumpkin selection is vast and they're nicely spread about so you're not all on top of each other to find the best ones. As you walk round, there are plenty of photo opportunity points. This is also good, so you're not standing in extremely long queues waiting to take photos.\n\nThe biggest surprise we had was the price at the end, genuinely very reasonable! We have been to a few different pumpkin picking places and so far the pumpkins here have been the cheapest. We did attend an early bird session, so this may have been the reason the pumpkins were cheaper but even so, it was worth it. The ticket price was also very reasonable.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend coming here. The kids will love it!",

Perhaps we went on a day where the characters were not there but there was no warning when we booked the tickets regarding this.\n\nOne bad thing is the car park for the actual pumpkin village. So many pot holes which encourages massive puddles. I get most people arrive and have their wellies packed, but parking becomes a problem because nobody wants to park where the puddles are, so they don't have to struggle getting in and out of their cars.\n\nI did see the maintenance team addressing problems with the pathway and the muddy sections inside the pumpkin village which was good.\n\nI would still recommend coming here, the kids still enjoyed it but it just has been better for us previously.",

Really overpriced as they would be £1.50 at any other pumpkin patch or supermarket, so glad we didn’t pick up any bigger ones, as just these little 3 are really over priced. I believe they import them in which is why they are over priced but something needs to be done to make them cheaper, especially tiny ones.

This is a family run, and very friendly working farm, with plenty of pumpkins to choose from. We spent ages choosing our pumpkins in the field, then did the Woodland walk, and finished off with a lovely hot chocolate at the refreshment tent. We got to meet the owners and their children, who were so polite and well mannered. We took home four giant pumpkins, and four smaller different varieties for £20, so it was very reasonably priced and far more personal than shop purchased. We all got completely covered in mud, and that just made it even more fun in my opinion. Wear sensible shoes, expect to get dirty as you are on a field open to the elements, and you will not be disappointed. We will definitely be back again next year!! 😁🎃",

The displays made from hay bails are fab and the atmosphere great as everyone's getting nice pics. There's little wagons to carry the pumpkins in or use as a photo prop and even new born lambs and calf's.

A standout feature is the Strawberry Thief Trail, a fun, themed walk through the fields that keeps kids entertained while you're picking. It's a charming, family-friendly destination that provides a great break from city life, where you only pay for what you pick",

We went with our 3.5 year old (who is vehicle/tractor mad)  and 8month old and both had a great time. On our visit at the end of August 2024 there was a large inflatable tractor bouncy castle, welly wanging station, noughts and crosses, a large tractor riding area (with plenty of pedal tractors and walking tractors for the little ones), hay bale pyramid, hay bale animals, bench swing and pumpkin patch to see!\n\nThe main attractions are the two corn mazes (one easy and one harder) for which you are given a really well made map and stickers for the little ones to keep engaged throughout the maze. The smaller maze will take you approximately 15minutes where as the harder one is closer to 40/45min with children. Both our children who are not the most patient were entertained the whole time and there are the right number of clues and checkpoints.\n\nThe owner and staff are super friendly and really care about providing a positive experience and it shows. There are a small range of refreshments and ice creams/ice lollies and picnic tables dotted around (some under cover for shade).\n\nA little bonus is that tractors and large farm vehicles are sometimes seen in the car park area (car parking is ample) which for any kids who love vehicles is another plus.",

The second barn had two food vans (waffles and toasties) that are perfect after a cold and windy pumpkin pick. There are even several portaloos with a baby change! We go every year and it is always a treat. However, go with white trainers at your own petrol - definitely pack boots or wellies!!! It is also dog friendly, they just need to be on the lead.",

Loved how they had smaller ones at the end in giant crates to make it easy to choose with clearly marked prices for each.\n\nAlso, it's great that the pumpkins are measured fairly in homemade wooden size guides!\n\nFun decorations dotted around the field, portaloo toilets onsite, little sweet stall on site, and a black van serving hot drinks! Also, pumpkin face stickers are available to buy to take home and stick on your pumpkins if you don't want to carve!\n\nPop it in your sat nav and sloe down because it's easy to miss the turning on arrival, maybe a bigger sign could help with this :) not a gripe just we drive past and missed it the first time.\n\nCar park warden very helpful and on hand, lots of parking in the field, wear wellies if you're precious about a bit of mud.\n\nIt was a lovely little afternoon out here.

The displays were brilliant, well thought out. Staff happily helped us take our group photos which are now very special photos, thank you! The fair ground rides were brilliant, was lovely to have more traditional rides rather than the flashy newer rides. Loved the makers market, was great to celebrate local small businesses, please keep this every year along with the social media promotions! The whole place was well thought out, areas for toddlers, seating, marquees, displays, signposts, celebrating all things pumpkins. I just wasn’t prepared to spend so much, I wish I was more prepared.

Perhaps not a lot to do for older kids and no animal feeding options when we went (Easter) so animals were visible but you couldn’t pet them (except the pigs). There was a little food hut and a marquee to sit in. Small shop. The highlight was definitely the lamb cuddling (which ran very well and the people were lovely and chatty) the farmer even went and got a gorgeous piglet out for us to say hi to!

Great sized park but my two enjoyed the hay most of all, interactive with the animals really broke up the day and lots of photo opportunities. Over all the prices were more than acceptable and the staff are wonderful. We moved our day due to a sick child which wasn't an issue for staff and gifted some food as one parent with that child didn't make it in the end. Really appreciate the thought from the team and all pleasant to talk to. Amazing 🤩\nYes I'd recommend, take your time, don't rush and just let the kids be kids.",

Im very sorry to give a negative review for the cafe but everything was cold and unedible the bacon was so hard i couldnt bite it at all. Sorry.   Back to the farm they have quite a few animals but unfortunatly my gr8 grandaughter wasnt interested in the animals just the play areas but she is only 21/2 lol i will go back it was a lovely day out. We only travelled from scunthorpe so not too far away",

The cafe is really nice with reasonably priced food. The toddler group is brilliant. Different theme every week where you do a farm activity and a craft - really good value. We've been to two.

The animals that are there well worth seeing though. The piglets being especially cute.\nPlenty of grass areas and benches to picnic but the cafe served decent looking food at standard prices. The maize maze was huge and had things to find for the kids to get sweets at the end.\nAs clean as could be expected considering the amount of children running around and good hand washing stations.\nA full day there might be tricky but even a few hours are still worth it for the cheap entry cost.",

I got jerked chicken legs which came in a foil container for the oven and it was delicious. Good quality chicken and a generous portion size. Lots of options if you’re having a barbecue  and also some fancy prepared meats. Pies, sausage rolls etc, some ready meals, bakery items such as biscuits, but not as many options for you if you’re veggie, vegan or don’t eat red meat or wheat. Will pop back next time I’m in the area for another treat dinner. My only criticism was that I cycled here and I couldn’t find anywhere to chain my bike.",

It is my sincere hope that I will not have the misfortune of encountering such a person again. Her demeanor unfortunately detracted from the overall experience.

From the moment we arrived, everything was perfectly organized and welcoming.\nThe tulip fields were immaculately maintained, showcasing an incredible variety of colors and creating a magical atmosphere. The cleanliness of the entire place stood out, including spotless restrooms, which is always a plus. There was a strong sense of safety throughout the venue, and the staff provided excellent service at every point.\nOne of my favorite parts of the visit was the option to buy marshmallows and roast them over an open fire — a simple yet charming touch. I also loved the Ferris wheel, which offered stunning panoramic views of the tulip fields, making the experience even more memorable.\nThe farm offers free, spacious parking, and there are several food vendors and restaurants on site with very reasonable prices. It's clear that the space is thoughtfully designed for visitors of all ages.\nThis is the perfect destination for a day out with family or friends. You can even bring your dogs, which makes it even more special for pet lovers. Honestly, I wouldn’t change a thing — everything was just perfect.\nHighly recommended!",

The grounds were in fantastic condition and well kept. Paths were well marked out and disabled friendly. Plenty of seating available at all times and a huge variety of food options available from pizzas, burgers, loaded fries, donuts, pancakes ice cream and coffees.. just to name a few. The staff were welcoming, helpful and always available to assist. There was a large amount of staff and security around the fields themselves, probably to stop visitors from picking the tulips, but whilst we were there we didn’t see any issues and everyone seemed to respect the rules.\nWe arrived at 11.30am and stayed until 2.30pm, but due to other commitments we had to leave but definitely could have spent a few more hours there enjoying the views, good food and entertainment. My daughter loved the enchanted forest walk and ferris wheel they had there. Would definitely recommend visiting. The photos speak for themselves… stunning.",

Lots of groups of children ruining it for smaller kids by sitting on the roof area and gathering to stop kids getting through. Young girls staffing the bouncy castle area were sat on their phones and when approached the kids they didn’t take much notice. I saw some other staff take a more stern approach as it was clear some kids got through the fencing and hadn’t paid.\n\nFinal straw was leaving the event and seeing two men offering to have a fight. They went in to the staff area together very aggressive so I think they must have been staff.

A shop is there too and guides who can tell you about the farm and also the history of the wharf. There is a blacksmith there too. The building used for this is the old receiving station where Dr Ricketts assessed smallpox patients.  The wharf was originally called Albion Wharf before being bought by the Metropolitan Asylum Board (MAB) for £13,000 in the early 1880s. There are some pieces of MAB china in a display case; various  boards display historical facts about different eras with drawings and photos. An outstanding place!

Apart from the sheep and the frogs, the animals have very little space and the farm is between two train tracks.

I imagine that the volunteers do all they can to help the animals, and I believe that there must be more funding and investment to care appropriately for the animals, but they need urgently to move the place away from the tracks and to give more space for the animals.",

A good variety of food for meat eaters and vegetarians however not sure on a vegan choice.  Fairly priced on the whole , a little disappointed by the number of wedges given for £6.95 however that would not deter us from eating there again.  The staff without exception were smart and friendly which is a definite plus.  This might sound silly but the toilets were spotless too although the restaurant had been full - so that’s another thumbs up! Well done to all.",

One major benefit of this farm (at least for Pumpkins) is NO need to book - unsurprising as the field is full of Pumpkins of all shapes & colours ! Parking spaces are plentiful too - although during wetter weather, be careful as there will be a lot of mud around ! As well as crop picking, a minature railway operates, kids face painting is sometimes available, & there is a small kids play area. The Hayloft is the site cafe, with friendly staff, nice food & drink ... but it is a little pricey (£3.00+ for a Tea).",

          "text": "I've driven past this PYO a few times when travelling to and from Gloucester, and although I live around 50 miles away, I thought on a weekend I'd pick up some PYO.\n\nArrived with my partner and 4-legged friend. The place was busy but managed to get parked. The PYO is in a separate hut to the cafe or shop. I asked for 2 punnets (1 for strawberries and raspberries). I went to walk in with my partner and dog and immediately told no dogs. I asked why and was told because that's the rule.. (no explanation, no signage, and nothing on the website).\n\nI entered the strawberry bays and found a really poor quality of fruits. Some of the plants were overgrown with weeds, and much of the fruit was either small and withered or just small and hard. I ended up walking 4 bays to fill what was around a third of the punnet. So after negotiating the children picking and eating every berry they could lay their hands on, I decided to  head to the raspberry bays.\n\nWhat a disappointment. The plants were in a poor state with quite a few dead, dried up and other with fruit already savaged by mites and other insects.\n\nI walked back to pay for my strawberries. When I arrived back, they placed the strawberries in the punnet straight on the scales. There was no mention in the pricing per kg that the punnets' weight was included, which I do think should be stated. In the end, they cost me almost £6\n\nTook them home and to be openly honest the quality was no better than supermarket. It was not a great experience.",

St Werburgh’s City Farm is the sort of place that makes you stop and think—think about life, about community, about the sheer, unadulterated joy of doing something useful with your hands instead of hammering away at KPIs and ROI projections that will ultimately mean nothing when you’re worm food.\n\nWe came here today as part of a work volunteering scheme. And this is, quite honestly, one of the best days of the year for me.\n\nOur host for the day was the utterly brilliant Alex, the farm’s site manager. You meet a lot of people in life, and some of them just get it. Alex gets it. He has the rare ability to be both welcoming and efficient, gently herding our corporate rabble into something resembling a useful workforce without once making us feel like we were in the way (which, let’s be honest, we probably were).\n\nWe dug holes. We built fences. We did some plumbing. We even built benches. But more than anything, we took time out of our lives to be in nature, to be with people, to be part of something real.\n\nBecause that’s what this farm is: something real. It’s for the community, run by the community, benefitting the community. It reminds us that life isn’t about boardrooms or spreadsheets, but about connection, about getting your hands dirty and actually doing something.\n\nIf you get the chance to visit, go. If you get the chance to volunteer, definitely go. You’ll do yourself some good. You’ll do the community some good. And, in the end, that’s what life is really about.",

This industrial chic deli/take-away/dine-in in the village centre has a wide selection of menu meals, cakes, snacks, and drinks.

We went for a weekend breakfast and will definitely repeat the experience next time we are in the area (and even travel for it!).  The premises is easily accessible for people with limited mobility - although the toilet facilities are a bit of an adventure for anyone (obtain key-walk a few doors down the pavement - up a side alley and unlock!) and I suspect not easy for people with mobility issues, or children. But this one slight negative is vastly outweighed for me by the excellence in every other sense.",

It was clarified that the first individual who had previously reached out to me was not, in fact, the manager. The genuine manager took the time to listen to my concerns, extended a sincere and unreserved apology for the poor experience I encountered, and assured me that this did not reflect the standards they strive to uphold as a business.\n\nIn an effort to rectify the situation, he kindly offered to provide me with a complimentary replacement order of the item I had originally purchased. To my amazement, the replacement was promptly arranged and delivered to me without delay. The quality of the order I received this time met my expectations and reflected the level of service I had initially hoped for.\n\nThis thoughtful gesture not only resolved the immediate issue but also demonstrated the company’s willingness to take accountability and place customer satisfaction at the forefront of their operations. Such responsiveness has helped to rebuild my trust and confidence in this butcher.\n\nWhile my first experience was disappointing, I now feel reassured that the business is committed to addressing concerns when they arise and to ensuring customers leave satisfied. Based on this positive resolution, I am now able to recommend this establishment with confidence and look forward to continuing future orders with them.",

It took about an 1hr to get through. They sell all kinds of meat and other things that are more specific to African food.  I didn't find this place any cheaper than Asda, in fact it was more expensive to buy pork and chicken. I checked the prices.  Fish, however, was much cheaper than at Asda and much larger cuts. Red meat, beef, ribs, lamb etc was marginally cheaper as well, except for minced beef. I was very disappointed to learn that the chicken was frozen. Made me think that it wasn't fresh.  This should be a farm, why is the chicken frozen? However, the size of the birds was slightly bigger than that of Asda or Tesco. But I still prefer to buy from Asda or Tesco because it's not frozen and cheaper.  Overall, I don't think I will go back. There are cheaper places in Bradford to shop.",

Even though it’s not huge we stayed for almost three hours as it’s so relaxing and inviting. So much for the kids to do, sand pits, mud kitchens, feeding the animals. They had pigs, donkeys, rabbits, Guinea pigs, cows, sheep, bee hives. It was just awesome! We felt super safe to let the kids play while we had a catch up and we brought our own food and ate at one of the picnic tables.\nEven though it was busy it somehow reminded calm and peaceful.\nThey’d sold out of eggs in the shop so I’ll definitely be back for some of those. And the team who work there are the friendliest bunch of people, they made us feel really welcome.\nOne of the loveliest things is that it’s free which means everyone can visit and take the opportunity to have a beautiful day out without it costing the earth. They have a donation box if you feel you can afford to give something.\nAll in all it was the perfect day and we can’t wait to return.\nThanks for having us, there just be more of these around the city, people would be much happier  ☺️",

The restaurant is nicely decorated with outdoor play area and where nearly all tables outside had umbrellas. Lunch option is a little limited with no chips or fried food BUT the quality of their food is exceptional. They have a selection of sandwiches, sausage rolls, brunch items, and childrens menu. The cakes are good sized and perfectly baked. Coffees were also of high standard.\n\nThe fruit farm had a good selection of blueberries, raspberries, goosberries, blackberries and currants. They have strawberries but they stated no strawberry picking at the moment. There were loads of raspberry bushes but there was a large patch that had dried thick stalks poking from ground within each of the aisles making it slightly hazzardess to walk pass (not seen these in other farms) so giving 4 stars rather than 5. However, all in all, a pleasant spot for a day out. Note that is an entrance fee of £2 per person then to pay for the fruit afterwards. Thank you for a lovely day. :)",

Everything was well-maintained, and the flowers looked stunning under the sunshine. It’s truly a place that lifts your mood and makes you appreciate the simple beauty of nature. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a calm, family-friendly, and Instagram-worthy spot. 🌻✨",

Service was fairly quick. Ordered the cheese and pickle sandwich (always a good fallback option if you're not sure what you want, and there was plenty to choose from here). A generous sandwich with salad, coleslaw and crisps on the side went down very well. All level access and spacious interior so I would not imagine wheelchair access being a problem. High chair available for the little ones. Nice views out over fields from the outside seating area. If you're passing through and in need of a little refreshment try this one out.",

I visited today - a Monday, not much on the menu,only three ice lolly’s left and that’s it. The indoor eatery requires updating, The chairs have torn seat cushions, and some of the area around is torn, but it’s free, and there’s always wear and tear. Also, they sell fresh meat produce - farm owned. I didn’t find the staff friendly at all. Chef was very moody, the cashier man didn’t have any customer skills - no hello or thanks, and the lady at the meat counter was harsh when speaking. I’d go back, but I wouldn’t buy or eat there.

We had a tractor ride, met lots of lovely animals and the children had mini tractors to ride on. Pumpkin fields were amazing and wheelbarrows provided, it was a great place for our son to be free and enjoy himself. There's a farm shop and a little cafe/restaurant too. They currently also have a maize maze, which looked great but we didn't go in this time. Staff were lovely and friendly, we really enjoyed ourselves. There is also a small playground which made a nice touch, we will return at other times when there isn't an event to see the animals, have a play and some shopping/ lunch.",

From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel completely welcome – friendly, attentive, and genuinely happy to help. It’s clear they care about their customers, which made the whole visit feel really special.\n\nThey even have a kids’ afternoon tea, which my friend’s child absolutely adored! It was the perfect size for little ones, beautifully presented, and clearly made with care – watching her enjoy it so much added an extra layer of joy to our day. I had the gluten-free afternoon tea, and I couldn’t have been happier. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and perfectly made – you wouldn’t even know it was GF if you weren’t told.\n\nThe atmosphere is so relaxed and welcoming, perfect for families or just a quiet catch-up with friends. I loved how thoughtful every detail felt, from the presentation of the food to the little touches that made the experience memorable. And the best part? It’s very affordable considering the quality, service, and care that goes into every aspect of the visit.\n\nI genuinely can’t recommend Scott’s Kitchen enough. Between the delicious food, attentive staff, and the family-friendly touches, it’s a true gem. We left feeling happy, full, and already planning our next visit – it’s that kind of place that sticks with you.",

The portions seem smaller the mushrooms are like shoe leather the eggs are awful however they're cooked,the majority of the items are cold  and what was once a great service with lovely friendly staff is now non existent.Today for example we waited ages to be sat down while the immediate member of staff was taking a booking on the phone, in front of us were two staff members chatting away and seemingly oblivious to our presence,when the phone went down the male member of staff who had previously ignored us then approached us to get sat down. After having a meal which was far from satisfactory ref the reasons given earlier in my overview the same member of staff who was on the phone passed us  and l tried to catch her attention that we might pay seeing as she had the mobile key pad payment machine in her hand on three occasions l was ignored as she was busy chatting to customers she seemed to know general small talk gossip this went on for about 10 mins then my friend said I'll go up to the counter and pay there were about three others waiting to pay seemingly fed up sitting waiting to settle up and indeed the lady sat next to us voiced her disappointment in the service saying it took ages to get sat and she was still waiting for her coffee with once again the majority of the staff standing around gossiping a  grinning at one another at approximately £35 for two breakfasts poor service and awful food l certainly won't be back or recommend again what a waste of a lovely setup the managers need to address this now",

It is now £5 an adult £2.50 for a child plus the optional £3 food bucket. Nothing has changed to justify the hike in admission price - I understand the increase in expenses of the farm but if your going to charge such admission the least you could do is tidy it up. The farm itself is a bit of a state - piles of manure, several derelict vehicles around, hazardous building equipment and materials lying around. 80% chickens, a couple of cows, pigs, donkeys goats and wallaby’s. Oh and if you’re lucky you’ll see the rats too.",

          "text": "We visited Farmer Palmer’s on a rainy Monday during the summer holidays. Although we had pre-booked online, it was surprisingly quiet—likely due to the weather. Despite the rain, we had a fantastic day! My 3-year-old and my friend’s 4-year-old were absolutely in their element. There was so much for them to enjoy: they held guinea pigs, fed the deer and goats, and even my 1-year-old loved the bumpy tractor ride (an extra cost of £2.50 each and under 2s were free). The kids explored all the play areas and had a blast on the dinosaur trail. We stayed from 10am until 4:30pm and never once felt bored! I’d highly recommend it for a family day out. We brought a picnic for lunch and found plenty of spots to sit and eat. We ended the day with a cup of tea and an ice cream in the café—great value at just £5.50 for both. The staff and animal care team were very friendly and polite!\nInitially, I thought the £20 ticket price for anyone over 2 seemed a bit steep, but considering how much we did and how long we stayed, it turned out to be excellent value. There were still activities we didn’t get to! I’d definitely return in the future—100% worth it.\n\n(Updated from a 4 star review I made 6 months ago)",

The animal feeding is free and a lot of fun — a real highlight! Staff were very friendly and helpful throughout. The dinosaur walk was pleasant, with a nice path around a pond. However, it does feel quite expensive for what’s on offer, considering the size and scope of the attractions.",

Beautifully and lovingly run, this place is incredibly family-friendly with a welcoming, relaxed atmosphere.\n\nThere’s plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors, a great play area, and a spacious green area for the kids to enjoy. They even provide toys and books, which was such a thoughtful touch. The staff were all smiling, friendly, and genuinely seemed to enjoy being there — it made such a difference.\n\nThe food was on another level — absolutely delicious and incredible value, especially with their “kids eat for £1” offer. One of the best lunches we’ve had in a long time!\n\nWe also loved the nature trail and were delighted to see pigs, chickens, and goats — the kids were in their element.\n\nWhat really stood out to us is the ethos behind this place. We love that the establishment supports providing opportunities for adults with varying support needs — such a beautiful mission and clearly part of what makes this place so special.\n\nCan’t recommend it highly enough — we’ll definitely be back!",

The food’s usually great too, their breakfast is lovely and their sandwiches are super tasty. But this time we chose to have the burger and it was a bit disappointing. For £15.50, the burger only had pickles, and nothing else..not even sauce, causing it to be quite dry.\n\nThe salad didn’t help much either, just plain leaves in a cup, no tomatoes or dressing. On the bright side, the fries and coleslaw were amazing! I’d definitely come back for the fries!\n\nI really hope they rethink the burger, even just a nice homemade sauce would make a huge difference.\n\nI’m giving it 4/5 as our other experiences have been really good.",

An outdoor seating section with tables and chairs to enjoy the weather would be a great idea.\nGreat selection of pies, had a cheese and pickle pork pie and the meat was slightly tough, however also had the rhubarb and chilli jam pork pie and it was to die for.\nAlso sells dixons ice cream and ice cream for dogs",

I had the Korean chicken sandwich minus the side salad (personal preference) mum had small fish and chips. Food was perfect, tasty, hot. Staff very friendly and efficient. Very reasonable priced will certainly be back for the cafe and the farm shop.\n\nBought a steak pie and almond slice tray bake from the farm shop again very reasonably priced very tasty food very friendly staff.",

It was a very grey day when we visited but we were lucky to get a table by the window and the view was still lovely.\nThere was a good choice on the breakfast menu and prices were very reasonable. We opted for a sausage and bacon sandwich with extra black pudding and eggs benedict. Both were very good and generous portions. The lunch menu also sounds very good, so we will definitely be returning soon.\nThe farm shop is next to the cafe and has a great selection of products, generally a bit cheaper than a lot of the bigger farm shops, so also worth a browse around.",

No stingy portions and the staff are more than happy to be accommodating if like me you are a slightly picky eater. I am always kindly given a doggy bag as I rarely make it through my whole sandwich but I enjoy the treat of having more later in the day at home. The shop is also great. Butchers in particular are top tier and the staff are really lovely and eager to help and advise with choices. I am very excited about stocking my fridge up from the shop this coming Christmas! Will make for a gorgeous roast!",

Our order was taken promptly by Sophie, who was so personable and friendly.\n\nWhen the food arrived, it was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious.

Before the sandwich had good filling with four bacon, three sausage with a runny egg. This time there were only two sausage and bacon with hardly any mushrooms and a dry tea cake and egg. I explained to the woman in the cafe that I got more filling and not dry bread like last time, she argued that we have never put that much filling in the sandwich. In the end I asked for a refund won’t be going there again in the future, In the past end I got my refund hence my the two stars.",

While the drink served to us came in a cloudy-looking glass and the drink bottle was in the glass (which didn’t feel very hygienic), the rest of the experience made up for it. The food was absolutely delicious! We had the fish gujouns, coronation  chicken burger, and the crispy chicken burger — all were full of flavor and generously portioned.\n\nDespite the small hiccup, we enjoyed our time and the meal.

The summer pass is such a good purchase, includes a foam party at 3pm each day very exciting for the kids and a great way to finish off their play. Plenty of seating and benches scattered about to sit back and watch the kids play, It has a Lovely clean, indoor play area, and imaginary play, friendly staff, good food & prices. Yes there isn’t lots of animals but there’s enough and the rest of the play & fun makes up for this I don’t even bother visiting others now as they just don’t compare!",

The outdoor  space is always a bonus when you have kids and there were extra  activities on the field eg. badminton, hoop throwing, rope swing and zip line and more…It was a very hot day yesterday  around 28 degrees?? The metal  slide in the park was hot under the sun therefore the  kids and unable to play on it, an open canopy or some kind of shade would have been useful also for the  large bouncing  pillows they were quite hot under the sun and unfortunately the kids soon give up on those. We would have liked more animals and more interaction with the all of the animals but understand this is difficult to safely provide.\nWe had a great day out, great facilities at the farm. Enjoyed our picnic ,Stayed for there for nearly 6 hours.",

Lots of opportunity to see nature on the well laid out trail around the farm yards. Well maintained (nothing is new, it's very 'rustic' with lots of repurposed bits and pieces but clearly well looked after) with informative signage everywhere.

It was very dirty, especially the toddler section, which definitely needs a deep clean.

The green open space was perfect for children to run and play freely, and the food selection, though small, was always clean and pleasant.\n\nWhen we heard about the addition of a soft play area, we were excited, thinking it would enhance the experience and offer even more activities for the kids. Unfortunately, our recent visit left us deeply disappointed.\n\nIt’s sad to see such a large area with so much potential being neglected. The outdoor space remains untouched—no new play areas, no upgrades. The animal enclosures seem poorly maintained. The area that once housed ducks and chickens now appears overrun by rats. The cow and donkey pens were dirty and unpleasant to be near.\n\nThe new soft play area is very small, with limited options for both small and older children. The cafe was another letdown. When I asked about food options, I was told they close at 4 PM, with last orders at 3. The choices were minimal—just a few sandwiches, pizza, and not much else.\n\nIt’s such a shame. This is a beautiful location with a huge green space that could be turned into something truly wonderful for families. With some care and vision, they could offer clean facilities, a nice outdoor play area, a better cafe, and more variety of well-kept animals",

But it also has 2 outside seating areas where you can eat and drink. One is in the quadrant the other opposite the field.\nI had the salad tray, my husband the ploughman tray and my grandson brownie and sausage roll in that order. The food was fresh and delicious.\nIf you eat next to the field you will see sheep, goats and a very friendly alpaca.\nYou can buy food pellets for them and hand feed them. There is a sink to clean your hands following the feeding.\nLeft of the car park is another field with ducks, chickens and goats. Again you are welcome to feed them.\nIt feels far more casual than a petting farm and my grandson gets so much fun and joy feeding the animals, them and a brownie makes his afternoon.",

The cost is £9.50, or if you just have bread, it's still a staggering £6.50. The size of the bowl is maybe just shy of 3/4 the size of a Costa Flat White mug. The soup itself looked and tasted low quality like something from a can, with no toppings or presentation. The sandwich is very plain as well with minimal filling in some cases. My friend (who is very unfussy) complained about the strange taste of their toastie.\n\nWe needed to check allergens for Gluten Free and were directed to the QR code (they were not able to check themselves). This was an inconvenience for a number of reasons, however on getting the website up.. the whole screen of the allergens list was covered in ads! You could not make this up. You can barely read it and we were unable to determine the allergens.\n\nThe staff were highly polite though!",

We spent our seating time there swatting them.  It was most uncomfortable and our time there was cut short.

From the drop off point we walked less than 10 minutes to where we found them!  They are amazing to see and to watch and we were so glad we went!  The walk is up the road, not in the path on the golf course (we don’t see the sign originally), and there is a longer walk to see more of them, though we didn’t have time to enjoy that.  They have a great map with clear instructions on their website.  It was much easier to access than I originally anticipated.  A highlight for our trip for sure!!",

Fruit is not so easy to come by in Edinburgh but there was plenty here! I went to the produce stand and got blueberries and raspberries which were so delicious. Definitely a different flavor profile than the ones you buy in an U.S supermarket. I also stopped by the dairy market and got some delicious milk. It is pastureized unfortunately but had an amazing\nflavor to it as well. Lastly I stopped by the soap market and got some nettle soap which is great for eczema and other skin conditions.

The crispy skin wasn't very good, it's very hard. Normally you have to request for it anyway so just dont\n\nStrawberries were great from the grocery stall in the centre, could have been sweeter but were very juicy and  large. The only problem with that stall is the rather confusing promotion, there's many different signs saying different things and apparently all of the berries can be included in the 3 for 6.8£ deal, including some of the other fruits, but only 2 out of the 4 berries have the 4 for 8£ deal\n\nThe belted Galloway steak really was quite good, it's extremely tender (so much so that I overcooked the cap thinking it wasn't done yet) and full bodied. However there's also a pronounced bitterness, not sure if it's just my problem but that really affected the enjoyment\n\nKedar milk really was something. No wonder they have a perpetual queue,  come before 1030 for a shorter queue. One sip and you immediately can tell the difference between theirs and normal milk. It's got a very pleasant natural underlying sweetness, is full bodied, and creamy in a very gentle way. Absolutely delicious, high fat content but not off-putting in anyway.",

Food stalls aren't cheap, but we had burger and chips which tasted good. All stalls took card, the bar was card only. Lots of porta-loos. Large car park. It was very muddy so I recommend wellies!

Our kids (ages 3 and 6) absolutely loved feeding the goats and meeting the baby lambs. The animal petting area was a huge hit, with opportunities to hold rabbits and guinea pigs—such a gentle, hands-on experience that the children are still talking about.\n\nThere’s also a fantastic adventure playground, tractor rides, and a soft play area indoors, which came in handy when the weather turned briefly. Everything was clean, safe, and thoughtfully set up for families.\n\nWe were really impressed with the café too—great coffee, homemade cakes, and a decent kids’ menu with healthy options. Plenty of picnic areas as well if you prefer to bring your own food.\n\nWhat really stood out was how interactive and educational everything was. The talks and feeding demonstrations were engaging without being too long, and the staff made sure the kids could ask questions and get involved.\n\nWe spent nearly the whole day there and could easily have stayed longer. A perfect mix of fun, learning, and fresh air. We’ll definitely be coming back—and bringing friends next time!",

          "text": "A Fantastic Farm Adventure!\nWe stumbled upon this gem the night before our visit, searching for a local outdoor activity to enjoy with my three-and-a-half-year-old daughter. What a find! We snagged a brilliant weekday deal for £8.95 for both of us, pre-school holidays, making it excellent value from the off.\nWe added a bag of animal feed for £2, which was well worth it for the interactive fun. My daughter absolutely adored the 'caterpillar ride' – a charming journey snaking around a field, pulled by a quad bike.\nThe farm itself is easy to find with ample parking. The animals are incredibly well-kept and so friendly, happily interacting with the children who were petting and feeding them. Every member of staff we encountered was genuinely friendly and welcoming.\nBeyond the animals, there's a lovely outdoor park and an indoor play area complete with a café, offering plenty to keep little ones entertained. The views across the countryside are simply stunning too.\nWe also opted for the 'Farm Safari', led by a wonderfully entertaining gentleman. He took the time to stop at each animal enclosure, allowing us to get a closer look and plenty of photos – a highly recommended extra!\nAll in all, it was a truly fantastic and great value day out. We'll definitely be returning!",

Very knowledgeable about the area, farm and of course the animals.\nThey are happy to stand and talk to you about the farm.\nSo friendly and welcoming.\nThey have a little outdoor play area and bounce pillows and tractors to ride also.",

The tractor ride was great fun, we got to see what the rest of the farm had to offer, and though we missed the barrel ride, it looked brilliant (and both are free!). Lots of friendly animals to pet and feed, plus great play areas indoors and out – including soft play and go-karting.\nFood and drink were easy to find with a cafe on-site and a cool airstream food trailer near one of the play parks, which was really convenient. We visited during the Easter holidays, so there was an Easter egg hunt happening, along with some fairground rides and fun games at the bottom of the farm, adding even more excitement to the day.\nA great day out for kids and adults alike!",

The staff were helpful, Becca was exceptional though, what a credit she is to the company. Made us so welcome and made a fuss of our dogs.

I had a great chat about buying my Christmas meat here, looking forward to it.\nThe pie section was a joy to behold, and lead to great discussion on which flavour pork pies to try, they all looked so tempting  - the markings on top made sure I would remember whose was whose 😋\n\nThe tea room was very busy,  and it soon became apparent why, the choice of cakes, treats and meals was a delight.\nNext time I will book a table.\nStaff in every section were very kind, helpful and willing to assist my disabled friend.\n\nMy grateful thanks to all the staff here.",

          "text": "We visited the tearoom around 3:25pm with my 88-year-old mother, hoping for a pleasant stop before closing. Unfortunately, the whole experience was dominated by the management’s strict 4pm cut-off, which created a rushed and uncomfortable atmosphere.\n\nThe service was disappointing from the start. My mother was first given tea in a takeaway-style paper cup – the sort you’d expect from a high-street coffee chain – which felt totally inappropriate and out of place in what is otherwise a pleasant, traditional tearoom setting. For someone of her age and fragility, it was also impractical. I had to return it, and only then was it replaced with a proper teapot, cup, saucer and cutlery. That correction was welcome, but it should not take repeated back-and-forths to get something so basic right.\n\nThe food itself was acceptable: the sandwich and cake were fine, and the quiche was decent once warmed. But any enjoyment was undermined by the constant interruptions at our table. Staff came more than once while we were still eating to ask if we had finished and whether they could take things away. It gave the impression we were being hurried along, not welcomed to sit and enjoy our food.\n\nThis all tied back to the central problem: the fear of the 4pm curfew. Staff repeatedly reminded us the café was closing, and it was clear they were under pressure to get everyone out on time. The added threat of the main gates being shut at 4pm sharp left us with the uncomfortable feeling that if we didn’t leave immediately, we could actually be locked in. Watching staff and cars streaming out of the car park at 4:05pm only reinforced this absurdity.\n\nOverall, while the food was reasonable, the service and atmosphere were inhospitable. A place that advertises being open until 4pm should offer full service until that time, not serve takeaway cups of tea in a sit-down tearoom, rush customers mid-meal, and create anxiety about being locked in. Be warned: if you arrive close to closing time, you are unlikely to have a good experience here.",

The staff were incredibly understanding about the change in numbers, which we really appreciated.\n\nAhead of time, I called to ask if we could have our afternoon tea earlier than their usual 1:30pm start, as we had to be somewhere later – and they kindly agreed to serve it at 12 instead. We waited around 30 minutes, which was no issue, and ordered some iced coffees while we waited. To our surprise, these were included in the cost of the afternoon tea – such a thoughtful touch!\n\nWe were given access to the upstairs area, which is closed off from the main space – ideal so we didn’t disturb other guests. They also let us decorate it how we liked, which made it feel extra special for the occasion.\n\nA big thank you to Mel, the manager, who was absolutely amazing – friendly, courteous, and made everything run so smoothly. We felt really well looked after and wouldn’t hesitate to return. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a warm, welcoming place with great food and even better service!",

Just make sure to check the weather before you go and dress accordingly — it’s a proper farm, so comfy shoes are a must. Make to book your slots online in advance.\n\nAll in all, a refreshing and delightful escape from the city. Highly recommend!",

Loved the addition of the trail for the kids! Unfortunately alot of the pumpkins had started to rot which was the case for a few that we picked (due to the mud on them at the time we couldn't see the rotting) however we carved the good parts up and allowed our chickens to feast on the good bits so only a small amount went to waste!\n\nMake sure you bring wellies but my best tip is NOT to leave it last minute like us so you can really enjoy every part of the experience!\n\nWe had a wonderful time and look forward to returning next year!",

Still a work in progress. It could be an absolutely fantastic space as it is a quiet corner of the park, but still close to amenities like The Stables café and Main Play area. The Dower House is the base of Manchester and District Beekeepers so the orchard is in the ideal place providing bees with the food they need to survive and they, in turn, pollinate the trees and plants so that they produce fruit.\n\nThe orchard isn't just be made up of fruit trees. There will be nut trees, fruit shrubs and herbs that are loved by bees. Brambles will be cultivated and controlled, so that they allow other plants to grow.\n\nBlackthorn will be planted, to make Sloe Gin in the future. Updates to follow and the Team continues to nurture this area.......",

The sunflower field was past its best when we were there - it would have been nice to be able to walk the perimeter to extend the stroll. Choosing a few stems at the end of the walk to take home was a really nice touch.\nWe were planning on picking a bucket of strawberries but sadly the last of the strawberries were covered in mildew so we didn’t pick any at all. I understand that this is a result of the weather and can not be controlled, however making people aware before they come would be helpful. We did visit the raspberries and blackberries instead which were lovely and ripe and tasted great!",

It was the perfect day out – peaceful, fun, and filled with fresh air and sweet fruit. The farm is well-kept, easy to get around, and very family-friendly.\n\nWe went for fruit picking, and the strawberries were absolutely delicious – fresh, juicy, and sweet. There were plenty to choose from, and the staff were welcoming and helpful, giving us tips on the best spots to pick. The kids had a blast roaming around and filling their baskets.\n\nIt’s a lovely place to slow down and enjoy the simple pleasures. We’ll definitely be back again soon – especially during berry season! 🍓",

We also had a really tasty meal that consisted of all kinds of foods produced and farmed locally.\n\nWe paid just £5 for our son to access all the activities for as long as he wanted — excellent value. The service at the restaurant was nothing short of fantastic. Staff provided clear communication about short waiting times and made sure we had everything we needed. It was fairly busy, but they had great control thanks to their own booking system used as people arrived.\n\nPrices were fair, and the quality of the food was excellent. I even spoke to the chef, who gave me insight into their food sourcing — which follows a brilliant farm-to-fork ethos.\n\nThe market stalls follow the same principles and offer farm-fresh foods of all kinds at equally fair prices for the quality. Everyone we met was friendly and welcoming.\n\nWe will most definitely be back again soon for another affordable, fun day out.\n\nAs for previous reviews complaining about waiting times, unfriendly staff, or cleanliness — first of all, it’s a farm, not a five-star hotel. So grow up and get over yourself. Approach the place with kindness and patience, and you'll find it’s a fantastic environment with an excellent atmosphere.",

The activities were not only fun but also very educational, giving us the chance to learn more about farming and animals in an engaging way.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience, and we’ll definitely be coming back.

Very easy to navigate, informative and up-to-date,\nConcise directions from the website and easily found with Google maps,\nThe shop immaculate cleaned to within an inch of its life bright airy well displayed. When buying something, you're going to eat everything you want to see,\nAnd then there's the food. The fruit vegetable and produce is fresh. Laid out. Easy to see. Clearly priced and very competitively, but the meat is where they really shine. Some of the freshest nicest prepared, pleasantly packaged and well priced. At first glance you think not much cheaper, but it's enough to make a difference and the quality is beyond anything you have tasted anywhere else. I've been a number of times now and have never been let down. This includes the prepared meals which I find perfect for a quick lunch or a lovely evening meal without having to do all the work myself.\nJust outstanding all round.",

Talking to the staff you can tell how committed and passionate they are, about the surroundings and animal wellbeing ☺️\n\nWe booked an experience (tour & visting the mini moos 🐮) and unfortunately there was a stand still traffice accident which made us late to our booking. But we inform the staff and they were very accommodating as others were also stuck and waited until everyone arrived.\n\nEven if you don't book the tour you can walk around the fields and see the animals, vist the restaurant / café which has amazing food and drinks, butches and small petting farm.\n\nCan't wait to vist again!!",

The children had a wonderful time, and we were all excited and happy while picking strawberries. It was a beautiful experience for everyone.\nThe only thing I didn’t like was that there was no clear pricing sign for the fruits we're meart to pick. We were so caught up in the excitement of the experience that we didn’t think to ask about the cost, and they turned out to be quite expensive. So, be careful not to fill too many punnets before checking the price, as we did. Be careful, make sure you have cash, no credit card.\nAnother downside was that the children weren’t allowed to play with the toys unless we were having tea there which made my kids a littlebit sad. We had planned to, but after seeing how expensive the punnets were, we changed the plan.\nThere is a very clean public toilet on-site and a large parking area.\nOverall, it’s a lovely experience definitely a nice spot to visit and DELICIOUS strawberries. We would go again, but next time we’d be more mindful about how many punnets we fill.",

It’s always been busy when we go, you don’t have to book and it’s free entry sometimes you just have to wait a minute or 5 for a wheelbarrow to come available. There’s plenty of parking. They have pumpkins all different varieties, shapes and sizes and prices. We bought 4 £3 football sized ones, one that’s good for eating and then a load of funny little ones that the boys love £1.50 each. The people who own it and grow all the pumpkins themselves are really friendly and Mrs Pumpkin Patch at Christmas Tree Farm gave us some good pumpkin recipeideas we got our Christmas tree from them too last year and choosing it was every bit as good  as pumpkin picking.

Not once did they break character.\nThe play areas were a massive hit, both the indoor (which has a great selection of slides) and the outdoor.\nThe cafe was good, a decent price, and had a great selection of cakes (the lemon doughnut was particularly yummy!)\nThe animals all looked well cared for, and as with most farms, they offered lamb feeding and small animal petting, although we did not do this. There are plenty of handwashing stations if you do feed or touch the animals.\nWe would definitely return and will look at booking for the Christmas event!",

The soft play area is a hit for all ages, featuring exhilarating slides—including one almost vertical for the older kids—and a giant climbing frame in the outdoor play area that kept everyone entertained. The farm itself is lively, with a great variety of animals adding to the charm. While it’s an overall great experience, just keep an eye on the smallest ones as there are a few dodgy spots that could use extra supervision. Overall, it’s a brilliant venue for a memorable day out!\n\nThe outside play area is a real highlight—spacious and perfect for a day out. There’s plenty of room for kids to explore and enjoy activities like the big climbing frame, making it a fantastic spot for active play. Plus, the picnic area is well laid out, offering a great spot to relax and enjoy a meal outdoors. With food options available on site, you can easily refuel without having to leave the fun behind. All in all, it’s a well-rounded destination that makes for a delightful family outing!",

We went on a tractor ride up to the sunflower field where we had views for miles around and on the way back we say the hot air balloon take off. The live music, food and play area were fantastic and I even picked and bought some lovely flowers. There is a sand play area for children as well as another area with tractors to race and a brand new zip wire. It was a lovely evening for all the family.",

Best of all, there is no entrance fee which is amazing value compared to other farms. Highly recommend for a fun family day out.",

However, the edible pumpkin selection is absolutely superb. There are so many rare delicious pumpkins that are very hard to find elsewhere. We were so excited and surprised when we found out that they have our favourites - Hokaido, Spaghetti squash varieties.\n\nThe lady who greeted us was absolutely amazing and made our experience unforgettable. She told us about all the pumpkin varieties, which ones are best for eating and told us more about the ones we had picked out.\n\nThe pumpkins are reasonably priced by size.\n\nWe have already made the best pumpkin soup with a Guatemalan blue banana pumpkin, which the lady recommended us and it was delightful.\n\nWill definitely go back next year (or come back this year if we run out!) 🎃",

First you navigate a suitably spooky corn maze to find the clues with sound activated figures, to give you a little scare along the way. A sweet treat at the end if you complete the clues. Then grab a wheelbarrow and choose your pumpkin(s) from the fields they grow in. Huge choice of every size, so plenty for everyone.\nFor little ones who are doing the visit by day there is an activity/play area and farm animals as well as the maze to keep them amused.\nThe Tipi cafe has lovely home cooked food and hot drinks for young and old. There are picnic benches outside if you want to dare the cold and bring your own food.\nFinally a well stocked Halloween shop full of all things Halloween. Not cheap, but to be expected and there were a fair few pocket money Halloween items.\nThe setting in the beautiful South Northants countryside and the sometimes misty drive down country roads to this family run farm adds to atmosphere.",

The children loved that there was a scavenger hunt they could do as they went round picking pumpkins, and they loved the corn (maize) maze!! We took away 3 largish pumpkins for around £13 which is a bargain considering there was no entry fee. Lovely to know that any money raised will be going to a local school. Great job guys and real dedication from all volunteers involved in this project!",

Great value for money as its only £12 per car to park and gain entrance to the farm and have a wonder around and meet the animals. They have a huge field with lots of different pumpkins, all shapes, sizes and colours....which my kids loved to the point our wheel barrow was too full so we had to try and decide which to keep at the end. Pumpkin prices reflect other pumpkin patches I have visited over the years but felt there was lots more variety and choice at bates farm. The farm isn't huge but I found it very family orientated, with face painting for the kids and lots of cute places to take photos whilst we enjoyed cookies and coffee from the coffee van which was also reasonably priced. Also it was really nice for one of the owners to take time out to have a chat with us and gave us some tips on how to grow our own pumpkins next year on our allotment. So thank you.\nOverall a great day, weather was perfect and the farm was spot on. See you at the beginning of April for the lambing season. Can't wait to return. X",

A local suggested we try Trevaskis farm. Initially the menu felt quite confused with a mix of Asian foods, local fish dishes, and steak or burgers. We gave it a shot anyway and we were not disappointed. I opted for the burger, which was made to perfection. It wasn't one of these over stacked monstrosities, it was the perfect size with some amazing sauce on it. The rest of our table had the Sizzlers which looked and sounded good too. I had also heard of there being a reasonable selection of cakes. The selection is actually vast and with the option of going half and half for an extra £1, it felt rude not to - though actually I'm not entirely sure what a full size portion. It felt like we were being given an extra portion for £1, not half and half. The atmosphere was a bit odd, it felt like a cross between a canteen and a conservatory. It wasn't bad, it just had a slight garden centre vibe. Well recommend a visit if you're in Cornwall. I'd say it's worth a 35-40 minute drive if you're looking for good food and in the county",

I was very happy with my soup and gf bread. Portions were generous and reflected the price. At our table of 5, no favorite could be picked, especially with our group loving the pigs in blanket (kids), creamy squash mash, Yorkshire pudding, the turkey or beef, or the roasted squash, parsnip, and apple soup. Dessert was definitely taken to-go as we had no space in our stomaches but could not pass up the many wonderful options! Especially having so many GF options. We could not stay for dessert because we had to check-in to our hotel and put the kids to bed.",

          "text": "Read reviews and thought we have to have Sunday lunch there, seeing as we had been in the week to pick their wonderful PYO fruits and vegetables, however we arrived and were shown to our table, drinks came quickly, Don't Order the Squash it's just coloured water, I mean yes staff probably been told not to use too much but at least make it so it tastes of orange or Blackcurrant, the waiting staff were absolutely amazing, food was served quickly and we were informed the Lamb for today was rolled lamb so had some fatty areas, in other words it was a cheaper rolled breast or shoulder, that didn't put off the hubby but my son who's autistic has a phobia of fat so opted for the chicken, myself and my youngest son had their rare breed pork now when the food arrived it looked lovely, but it was Luke warm, which meant my husbands lamb left a grease lining at the top of his mouth, then came the potatoes, if you don't have your own teeth don't try and eat them unless you have used fixer that day, they had a solid exterior which was disappointing as they were a nice potato, the swede mash and the pork was absolutely amazing I really can't fault that, the lop rare breed pork is so flavourful its absolutely lush, but I have to sadly admit that the rest of the veg was terrible, the carrots hadn't been peeled and some looked almost dirty still at least give them a good scrub, yes I get veg is better in skin but carrots are always the exception, they were hard, so hard I couldn't stick a fork in, the cauliflower cheese was exactly the same although the flavour was nice the rest was just inedible, and peas and cabbage well it must have been dipped in hot water and that was all, they too were hard and inedible, the Yorkshires looked great and the top half was brilliant until the stodgy bottoms that had half the oil still sitting in them 🙄 overall the food was one of the most expensive, poorly cooked meals I've had, needless to say not one plate out of 4 were anywhere near clear, that really annoyed me as I hate waste but it was just terrible, after eating we sat there with our plates to the side and used napkins on top, yet 20 mins past and no one came to clear the plates, having a autistic child whom by this point wants to know where his dessert is and can he go home 🤦‍♀️ so I made the decision to head to the dessert counter ask for dessert to go and pay the bill. £97.15 for 2 adults 2 kids 3 pints of squash ½pt of Pepsi max and 2 childrens dessert and one adults, absolutely shocking for a meal that was wasted and to be brutally honest I've had better roasts off the too good to go app. I admit desserts were the best part and I was able to share mine it was that big, it was an awful lot of money to waste that's for sure.\n\nFurther to this When picking fruit the other day I brought some Judes chocolate custard that was reduced, it wasn't until I got home that day I had realised she had charged me full price, so today I took it back to the shop with the receipt to be basically called a liar by telling me that staff wouldn't have made that mistake if it was reduced they would have rung it up as so 😡 it's such a shame as I was so very impressed with them up until today, now I'll never visit again, even if their fruit is the most amazing, the way we've been treated today, is terrible. So annoyed",

          "text": "Thought we would try something new with the family today and headed for the Maize Maze and Fun Farm. For four adults and two children we were charged £60 when booking in advance. This felt quite expensive but we were willing to give it a go.\n\nOn arrival, it was fairly quiet which was a pleasant relief for a mid summer holiday afternoon. The 'farm' has a few animals to look at and feed (£1.50) including donkeys, llamas, geese, goats and cows. There was also a lot of open space with picnic tables, garden games, two trampolines, three bouncy castles and some other little bits. There is a very small cafe on site selling the usual things and an ice cream shack. I was disappointed to discover that the cafe would not refill water bottles for children nor were there any water points on the site. This seemed somewhat behind the times and not something I expect of a family attraction.\n\nThe main event was of course the maize maze which has two challenges. The first was very child friendly and not too long. The children had to find signs hidden in the maze and add stickers to their collection sheets. The whole family enjoyed this part.\n\nThe second challenge was much much harder and involved the same sticker process but I would not advise it for younger children. My two (6 and 4) found it very lengthy and got somewhat bored, very hot and a little grumpy. A solution map is available for £1.50 (refundable if not opened) and this became essential to completing the maze and indeed getting out! My children managed to escape with the grand parents before my wife and I completed the maze on their behalf! We enjoyed the challenge.\n\nAlso on site, is a slip and slide which claims to be the longest in the UK. This comes with an additional cost but we did not venture over or try that on this occasion. It was busy and did look good fun.\n\nOverall, we managed to spend a pleasurable afternoon here but I can't help but feel that £60 is somewhat steep given what is on offer. If your children want to try a different kind of maze which actually is very challenging then perhaps this place is worth a visit.\n\n@familydadventures",

The staff overseeing this were very helpful.\nThe maze is good too. Expect to need to use the map though (which I think is normal but it is given to you in an envelope and called a cheat sheet!) to find your way around and find all of the markers/activities for the children to find. The first part is simpler and the second a little more complex.\nThere are also picnic tables, animals and a play area with bouncy castles, swings and games.\nWe bought some drinks and food. The coffees were fairly standard and out of a machine but the pasties, sausage rolls and chips were good. All came out hot and the pasties were very tasty.\nOverall, a good day out.",

I am really bad at orienteering- especially in a field of corn where everything looks the same. But we tried the first half without map- 2h later took a break had lunch in cafe and returned to find more clues and 2nd trail. Cafe had amazing fresh cut chips- clean and spacious. There are also animals to feed - great for the little ones and even a slip and slide (extra fee) but it was cold and rainy on the day we visited so didn't have a go at that. A great day to be spent with family outdoor and you could get a family of 4 for £38. i will definitely return for the Haloween one",

The tour was fascinating and gave us a real behind-the-scenes look at the cyder-making process, as well as the history of the farm. Walking around the grounds was a treat, especially with the beautiful peacocks roaming freely — such a unique and peaceful setting.\n\nThe highlight for us was the jam and cyder tasting, and that’s where Lucy truly made the experience shine. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and made everyone feel welcome. Her passion for the products really came through, and she guided us through the tasting with warmth and enthusiasm. Every jam was delicious (we couldn’t pick a favorite!), and the cyders were outstanding — each one with its own unique flavor and character.\n\nLucy’s hospitality elevated the whole experience and made the tasting feel personal and memorable.",

          "text": "SMEATON FARM DO NOT DELIVER WHAT THEY PROMISE\n\nTHE GOOD.\nThe farm itself was in a stunning location, and although the room was tired and needed updating, it was extremely clean and replenished daily with clean towels - tea/coffee facilities etc. And the breakfast was fantastic.\nWe had pre ordered dinner for 3 nights a week before arrival, to make sure my wife’s diabetic needs for wholesome farm food was catered for, due to AA DinnerAward with extensive menu advertised @ Smeaton (photo).\nTHE BAD\nAlthough not their fault, they do not pre warn you about the narrow roads leading to their farm, with brambles & thick foliage, as we had a brand new Audi  Q7, large & particularly high value, the car is as wide as the roads (photo). You are in trouble with oncoming cars, and definitely a NO NO to go out at night or travel to find this place in the dark.\nTHE UGLY.\nAs we said, we had pre booked dinner.\nFor the first night, we were told pork would be served , so no choice, charging £30 pp- offering us the cheapest meat they could get away with on their menu, for more profit. We were agreeable, so as not to cause a fuss.\nThe second night  they had already informed us that they were off to a farm show, so no Dinner served, and we were directed to a local pub. this  they do on a regular basis (reviews) . And once again had no choice, but to agree.\nOn the 3rd night too we were told No Show for Dinner, leaving us in a predicament to try and find somewhere to eat in the afternoon, as we knew we could not venture out at night, leaving my wife vulnerable @ eating snacks we had carried.\nWe were only told about No Dinner once we had paid up, otherwise we would have not booked this place.\nWhilst we were there, I emailed the owner to inform him that, the pub’s around the area, were not suitable for my wife  and that we were struggling to find healthy food,  giving him the opportunity to redeem himself, but nothing phased him , instead directing us to a Michelin Restaurant which was condensing, as all we wanted was something healthy to eat as advertised by them.\nWe were not even offered a sandwich, which we would have paid for, or use of their kitchen facilities or fridge to store any food we may have purchased from outside.\nThe lack of Empathy and Care was shocking to say the least -see other negative reviews) as it clearly shows they have treated other guests badly going back years.\nOur issue is: Stop enticing people into staying with you, using your AA Dinner Award and packed picnic , (photo) which you cannot be bothered to serve and proudly advertising it at your front door. Menu simply there to capture our interest.\nReviews (excerpts) from other guests:\nThe only thing that let us down, was the reception on arrival. I was greeted with no smile, and when asked about evening meal, i was directed to the local pub, despite the website advertising food..\n\nWe were not treated with a friendly smile . Worst place we have ever stayed for service.\n\nRest of the family rude.they never smiled, served us looking grumpy & clearly do not enjoy running the B & B .\n\nAnd it goes on & on, other guests having similar experience as ourselves. Once money taken, they make you uncomfortable enough, that you want to leave as soon as possible. We did not have to be asked twice. We were out of that door first thing in the morning.\n\nSince this review on Trip Advisor,  Owner Richard, has answered us back in a private email  calling us Liar’s & the rest, knowing full well we had no right of reply on TA & threatening us with Litigation for simply giving an honest constructive review. He was quite happy to take the good part of our review but totally unable to handle the rest. At no time did he address, any of our concerns, simply stating that it would affect his business. If ours was the only bad review, we could simply put it down to the fact he was having a bad day. But this seems to be the norm for Smeaton Farm. Let us assure you, that you will not get a warm welcome at Smeaton farm, once your credit card details have been taken. Worst place we have ever stayed.",

Spending time with the animals, feeding and cuddling them, was so refreshing not only for the kids but for us as parents too. My husband definitely enjoyed dance with piggy mascot as well as our kids did.\n\nThe atmosphere is incredibly warm and welcoming. Everyone we met was kind and helpful. A special mention to Chris, the owner—we think he’s retired now—but he still shares stories about the farm with such pride and joy. He was genuinely inspiring.\n\nEven though the farm was busy, there were no queues for anything, which made the whole experience relaxed and enjoyable.\n\nHighly recommend this place for families with children, and honestly, for any adults who just want to reconnect with animals and nature. You can really take your time here—stroke, feed, cuddle—it’s just such a wholesome, lovely experience. We’ll definitely be back!",

There's activities every 30 minutes, favourites of my daughters were the bottle feeding of baby goats and the goat walking.\n\nThere are lots of animals to walk around and meet, and you can buy some animal feed and can feed certain animals too. They are all clearly sign posted which animals you can and can't feed. My daughter loved feeding the sheep and goats, and meeting the ponies in their paddocks. The little train ride was good fun too!\n\nThere are plenty of play areas, including indoor bouncy castles and a toddler area outside. Both were a hit with my daughter. The bubble and bop area was really good fun too. There's another big outdoor play area, but that's for older children, but it looked really good and I will definitely bring my daughter back when she's bigger.\n\nThe staff were all really friendly.\n\nWe had a hot chocolate and sandwich from one of the cafes whilst we were there. They were a bit expensive, but that's expected at places like this.",

I suggest booking online as they are really busy at peak times.\nThere is a large barn where children can cuddle all sorts of animals: mice, rabbits, baby goats and miniature pigs. You have plenty of time in there and can return later in the day. You can bring your own blanket or buy a small one at the farm entrance for £3.\n\nSo many activities, see the photo showing then all. Pig racing was really fun to watch.\n\nThere's a tractor ride, a small train, pond dipping , go karts and so much more.\n\nHighly recommend this place.\n\nThe goat feeding was funny to see as the children all line up around an enclosure fencing with the bottles ready and the goats are let out to excitedly find a bottle to feed from.\n\nYou can buy animal food to feed the alpaca, deer, goats etc.\n\nPlenty of food stalls with a good range of food and drinks. Not too bad prices for an attraction. There is a fire pit so you can buy marshmallows on sticks to toast there.\n\nThere is free mini golf to play, nice climbing structures and a maze too. Make sure to go for the whole day as you need it to do everything.\n\nWe got a discount code that allowed us to visit again within a week.",

We went on a busy day in August, even though the shows  had lots of spectators, the park seemed spacious for everyone and this did not distract from our day. The range of birds were magnificent and we especially loved the Red pandas. The keepers were very knowledgeable and you could see that the enclosures were clean and the animals were calm.  The play barn slides were a huge hit and great to cool off. There was a great range of toilets and open pathways for disabled access or pushchairs.

Thought it would be an hour walk around and a little boaring ,but was pleasantly surprised.\nWas there for around 3/4 hours.\nThe birds of prey show was really impressive and very informative. The kids didn't t moan they got board whilst we were there either, which they usually do so it must of been good.\nCafe was a bit steep so we went to eat somewhere else but the whole experience was amazing. Would definitely go again. 😊",

This was our fourth visit to this truly special place, and it speaks volumes that we’re already planning our return.\nTrevathan Farm Cottages has a unique charm that keeps families coming back year after year, and indeed, generation after generation. It’s a testament to the warmth and quality of this establishment that almost everyone you speak to here has been visiting for many years – some even for over two decades! This sense of community and shared love for Trevathan truly adds to the welcoming atmosphere.\nOne of the absolute highlights for us and our children are the morning tractor rides. They offer a fantastic, hands-on opportunity to witness a working farm in action. Whether you’re keen to get stuck in and experience farm life firsthand, or simply wish to sit back and soak in the breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside, these rides are an unforgettable experience.\nBeyond the organised activities, the genuine welcome extends to every corner of the farm. Our walks around the beautiful grounds were always made even more joyful by the company of the friendly family dogs, who love to join in and truly make you feel at home.\nTo the entire family and all the dedicated staff at Trevathan Farm Cottages, thank you.",

There are also the absolute cutest little lambs nearby. Parking is easy, and there’s a lovely little nature walk to enjoy as well.\n\nTo the café:\nThe staff weren’t very attentive—more focused on chatting with each other, and I had to wait for them to finish their conversation before I could place my order. It wasn’t a huge deal, but it did feel a bit like I was intruding.\n\nThe menu on our table was really worn and outdated. I ordered the cinnamon and apple pancakes, only to be told they’re not available anymore. I went with the berry pancakes instead. When I checked a different menu it indeed didn’t list the apple option so my menu on the table was just old — this just felt like a lack of attention to detail.\n\nAs for the food, the berries were clearly defrosted (very cold and unsweetened), and the pancakes were also cold and a bit dry, even with the cream and berries. Not awful, just a letdown for almost £10.\n\nOverall, the experience was just “not that great.” That said, lots of others seem to have had a better time here, so maybe I just caught it on an off day.",

As soon as we went to view it, we were taken aback by the beautiful views, the huge barn with ample space and the facilities we could use there.  We had our ceremony in the orchard which was simply beautiful, and adding a few hay bales we rented from the farm had the best country feel that we were wishing for!\n\nGrace was amazing from our first meeting, keeping in touch, putting us at ease. We loved how relaxed she made us feel, and it is clear to see how much she loves the farm/barn and her job. She is ace ❤️ on the day of our wedding, Grace was joined by Vicki who is equally lovely. They were such a fab team and kept everything running so smoothly for us!\n\nOur guests stayed in the camping field (making use of the two bell tents on offer, and also bringing their own tents) they had a blast and said the bell tents were so lovely and homely! Myself and my husband (ahhh 🥰) stayed in the beautiful shepherds hut which to be honest felt like a little retreat! After such a busy day it was so nice to just be us two in this space! It is honestly so beautiful!\n\nWe had a DJ which there was so much space for, and also a hog roast for our evening catering. It was the most perfect day, I just wish we could do it all again! We can’t wait to come back to the shepherds hut for our anniversary!\n\nTHANK YOU WEST TOWN FARM ❤️❤️❤️ you absolutely exceeded all of our expectations and we cannot get over our wonderful wedding day!\n\nYou have a special place in our hearts, forever ❤️",

The bee demo, candle making, talks and honey tasting (all included in the entrance fee) were highlights. The café deserves a special mention too; clean, very reasonably priced, speedy service and legendary cheese scones!\n\nIt would have been lovely to see a queen bee during the demo (sadly they didn’t spot one that day) and perhaps a live hive link or glass observation hive would add even more to the experience. We also hoped to try the honeycomb, which wasn’t available. That said, there was still so much to enjoy. Both the indoor play area and the spacious outdoor areas gave the children plenty to do, while the talks and tasting kept the adults engaged.\n\nWe visited with ages ranging from 7 to 83, and genuinely everyone found something to enjoy. A tip: plan for either the morning or afternoon session, as the talks run twice a day; check timings so you don’t miss the ones you want.\n\nWell worth a visit and one we’d happily recommend.",

Great service and very pleasant and helpful staff. Nice play area for kids and for £1.00 you can buy the kids a little bag of food to feed the sheep. We stopped for a break on the way home from our Cornwall holiday. So much nicer than a service station and lovely that my granddaughter could have a run around in a safe environment before continuing our journey home. Looks like they do music nights and weddings and much more Highly recommend",

The hash brown and tomato were probably the best parts, but the rest was pretty forgettable.\n\nWhat saved the experience a little was the chance to see some animals nearby. We happened to be there when a staff member was feeding them, which was unexpectedly fun.\n\nOverall, it feels like the prices might be marked up because of the farm setting and the animal “experience”, but in terms of food and value, I personally found it lacking.",

The fish and chips we reckon the best in Devon! Recent Sunday roast not as good as before because the potatoes were hard. We were offered replacement  new potatoes but took too long. We requested a discount as the quality did not reflect the increased menu price. They discounted the drinks instead.\nAn excellent choice of meats at the butcher's counter. Good fish counter too.

Absolutely Outstanding!\nAfter breakfast Rodney outlined the various areas of their business, and encouraged me to have a walk around the farm.\nBeing November it is a quiet time as far as fruit production is concerned, so I took a stroll to see the Free-Range Hens. They are in huge paddocks with vast areas of room for them to live in. It was obvious that they were Happy Hens!\nA visit to the Winery to see the extensive range of home produced fruit wines and preserves, was a delight.\nI am really looking forward to my next visit.\nMartin A\nKent",

Beautiful restaurant with extremely friendly staff and our dog can sit at the table with us.  A year ago I would have said the prices were a bit steep, but now I would say they were average, the food is excellent and you get very good portions, I was disappointed with the price  of a large rose!   £9…..  we all know how much a bottle of wine costs at a wholesaler and we understand that you have to make a profit but  that is outrageous. Anyway the lovely girl that served us was cheery and bright and she told us she  loved her job, I can see why. The farm shop was amazing,  too much to list.

There is lots to do on the site, crazy golf, maize maze etc but unfortunately these are at extra costs which we didn't realise before arriving and these things are quite costly, especially with a group of 6 people. The only thing included with the camping is the bluebell walk which was nice (even out of bluebell session) and the wallabiesare soooo cute. It would have been great if campers got a discount on the extras. The kids loved having the chicken wondering free and the ice creams. Service was slow at the pantry and all the staff we encountered seemed unsure about everything. Unfortunately on the Saturday night there was loud music playing until about 4.30am. We don't believe this was coming from the site but it was very loud so probably local which puts me off wanting to return.",

The coffee was on the cold side so we drank it quickly. The BLT at £9 was also disappointing there was no choice of bread offered. When it arrived the bread was white shop bought bread. With a name such as Butlers pantry, we would have at least expected a choice of white or brown and at least a sliced Bloomer that at least looked a bit more home made. The fillings were good but the presentation was let down by the poor choice of bread. Beginning of the season and the decking and unplanted planters looked tired and unloved. With a few minor tweeks, freshen up the decking and outside of the barn with a bit of stain. If you’re going to have planters, they are only a good addition if you have them planted and cared for. Other wise remove them and make the most of your space.\nLatchett’s dairy the gelato was delightful and well worth a trip out, it is worth noting they do not accept cash, card & mobile payments only.",

The cafe and farm are located in a beautiful valley a stones throw from Rye. We visted in late June and were not dissappointed with the amount of variety. We checked the blackboard for in season fruits, brushed up on the rules and grabbed four punnets and set off.\n\nThe orchards are spaced out nicely and on the day we visited it wasnt too busy so we were able to roam and pick at our own leisure, finding some decent fruits. We managed to fill three full punnets, one of strawberries, one raspberries and one of blackcurrants.\n\nWe got lost in the maze, which needed a little TLC, some of the passageways were a little overgrown and some nettles got the better of our kids shins, but thats what child hood is about exploration! The kids loved seeing the goats and playing on the old tractor\n\nAs is to be expected not everyone follows the rules and guidance and it was a shame to see people picking and then discarding fruit, but how can you police such a thing, ive seen some reviews that have marked this place down because others have moaned at them for not following the guidelines which i think is unfair on Tibbs Farm.\n\nAll in all we had a great day out and came home with some great tasting fresh fruit, some bottles of Tibbs Farm Apple juice. I would throughly reccommend Tibbs Pick your own as a day out",

The beds were comfortable with warm duvets and there was plenty of space for our family of 4.\n\nThe views of the farm are beautiful, and it’s nicely located so that you can hike on one of the South Downs paths, walk through the farm to a pub, or you can also drive down to the coast. We did a half day in Brighton, which gave us a nice mix of activities. There was also a corn maze on site, but we didn’t get around to doing it.\n\nThe location feels private and remote, but with young kids, we were reassured that our car was only a 5 minute walk away if needed and also cell phone service could be found again within a few minutes drive.\n\nThe toilets and shower and sink were all nicely maintained. Overall it was a really relaxing and peaceful experience sitting by our campfire, and cooking and sleeping outside. Our kids also loved seeing the sheep and cows nearby.\n\nWe had a great time and were really reassured given it was our first time taking our kids camping, and we’re not big campers ourselves. It was a perfect mix of nature whilst having some amenities on site.  Thank you!",

The last time we came was just before my son turned one, and he was a little too young to appreciate the full experience, so I can honestly say the experience this time was so much better.\n\nBoth kids absolutely loved the rides – which I think is one of the best things about this farm. You don’t just get to see and interact with the animals (which they also enjoyed), but there are so many rides (some of which are even suitable for babies) and outdoor play areas that kept them fully engaged. It really does offer something for everyone.\n\nThere were plenty of opportunities to meet the animals (we did the rabbit encounter), and we were lucky to catch the summer circus too – my children really enjoyed that. The staff stood out as well; everyone we met was so kind and friendly, which made the experience even nicer.\n\nOn top of that, there are indoor soft play areas for rainy days, but we had sunny, warm weather so the kids made the most of the outdoor climbing frames and slides. We visited from 10am until 3pm, but honestly, you could easily spend the whole day here until closing. My tip would be to arrive early: start with the animals and then move on to the rides once they open at 11am.\n\nA brilliant family day out – we’ll definitely be back!",

The set up is also very walkable with animals and rides and playgrounds interspersed ergonomically. They have a great variety of animals who seem happy and healthy. It's a little pricey, but it feels worth it to give money to a nice farm. I wish their food options were healthier - especially the snacks (having some fruit on offer for the kids would be helpful!)",

The Beast (giant inflatable castle) shut down at 4pm (it was open for a couple of hours and was the best thing there). After that, the whole farm seemed deserted and not much else to do. Funfair rides were shut when we walked through but one was open so we did manage one at least. Don’t know why they’re not always open? Not really unlimited, is it?\n\nFood and drinks expensive, £2.40 for a can of drink! At these prices, and not much going on, I don’t think we’ll be returning.\n\nMarsh Farm - clean up your act!!!",

Have visited twice in the past ( since Partyman operators took over) and find it's better to visit on quieter days if possible, as the site can get a bit overwhelmed when it has full occupancy, visitor-wise. As it is given, this was April HT rather than the 6-week holiday. Some of the things you can expect to see (Bubble & Pop Tent, Open swim/paddle area and grass-based LEGO/soft toy play area) in high summer were absent, but on this visit, the new Dinosaur attraction was open, and that made up for these omissions. This dinosaur attraction is obviously a big investment from the park, but a bit random as to the point of its inclusion, though it does have some cool features I have not seen at similar bolt-on attractions at other parks. If you take your time in truth, there is almost too much to see and do in a day, so my suggestion is to come early and take your time. We ate in the cafe, and it is a bit of a madhouse in there, in part due to the inclusion of the soft play area next to the cafe, but it does mean there is somewhere parents can safely eat and not have to watch 100% what their kids are doing. All the staff I've encountered on each visit have been lovely, and the only negative on this visit was that the mini train broke down just before we were to ride on it, and there were several areas closed off due to non-existent maintenance being listed as taking place (i.e. Mini Golf and the Maze).",

I took the family – all 10 of us – for a visit, and we had an absolute blast. From the moment we grabbed our wheelbarrows, it felt like a First Class experience – minus the champagne but with all the charm.\n\nThe field is brimming with pumpkins of all shapes, sizes, and colours, and as you meander through, there are games and activities (all free – unheard of these days!) to keep everyone entertained. The kids loved posing at the photo boards, and I’ll admit, the adults did too. Who doesn’t want a picture with their head poking through a giant pumpkin cut-out?\n\nThe café is the perfect pit stop for refueling. They serve up tea, coffee, hot chocolate, and freshly made cakes and biscuits. We grabbed a few slices and settled down on hay bales while watching the little ones play. It was a cosy touch, very much like sipping tea in the galley during a peaceful mid-flight moment.\n\nAnd the pumpkins? An absolute bargain. We managed to fill two wheelbarrows to the brim for just £35! If only luggage allowance were that generous. The surrounding countryside is beautiful, and there’s plenty of free parking, so no need to worry about squeezing into tight spaces like at Heathrow.\n\nAll in all, a perfect afternoon – family fun, fresh air, and a boot full of pumpkins. I’d say Sarah Green’s Patch definitely gets a ‘well done, cabin crew’ from me!",

It looks amazing and there are multiple photo opportunities.\nFor full disclosure, we purchased our tickets through groupon at a highly discounted rate, which felt like great value for money. I would not have been pleased with paying the prices on the website. Our tickets included unlimited rides on the fairground, which in all was only 8 rides. With the space they had, there could have been a lot more rides. The fun house was filthy inside and had multiple parts missing.  The haunted house was good, and the dodgems are always a hit.\nThe arts and craft tent is good fun albeit at firther cost. My children loved the sand art and getting their faces painted.\nThe food was a highlight for me, plenty of options, and I loved the under cover area. The theme ran throughout the whole event, which made transitioning between areas enjoyable.  The maze is basic but still good fun for the younger ones.\nThere are plenty of add-on bits to do at an extra cost, such as a circus, pony rides, and games.\nI was dubious about attending as I had heard that last year was not very good but they seemed to have improved and it was very busy.\nWe look forward to coming back next year and will aim to go in the evening as it seems to come alive after dark! 💀",

From start to finish, the level of customer service was shockingly poor. The staff were not only unhelpful, but downright rude on multiple occasion and so many lies told!\n\nWe approached a few different staff members for assistance with what should have been simple questions, and were met with  dismissive attitudes, and an overall sense that they simply couldn’t care less. There was absolutely no effort made to be understanding of our situation and why we could no longer visit.\n\nWhat’s most disappointing is that this is a place marketed as a family-friendly attraction – somewhere meant to educate and inspire children. Instead, we were made to feel unheard. It was clear that several staff members had no interest.\n\nThis experience completely shocked us and being told our number is being blocked and no correspondence from email even though we are still owed £238 of our money we tried to meet in the middle and ask for a partial refund or alternative booking when was more suitable for our situation but there was no compromise accept in the winter but even that was a lie because they close for certain months too so they made it completely impossible for us. They even told us that they wouldn’t tell there customers if there animals were to catch TB like local farms very close so who knows if this is a safe place to visit and take your family. Which was my very own concern. I would strongly recommend management take a hard look at their customer service standards, because this was unacceptable. There social media is full of false advertisement but yet they can’t even reply to help already paid customers. We will not be returning and will keep fighting for our refund!!!",

Activities on throughout day, with shows and dance parties. Not to mention the massive pillows! Well done whoever created this.",

The foam party was great fun too. I wouldn’t recommend getting the meal deal online for a family because they limit your options to the bare minimum and the price difference does make it worth it but the food was lovely the pizzas looked delicious we were gutted they weren’t part of the options. The staff members look like they’ve had enough of their jobs and were very miserable except the performing staff who were a delight. Overall a great day out highly recommend just a shame about the staff friendliness and food options.",

Even during the summer holiday break. He loved climbing high. The water pillows were fun. Although a lot of adults used them as sun beds. The had a paint run and foam party event which was also enjoyed. My only gripe was that you had to book for under or over 5s yet over 5s were allowed in with there under 5 siblings. So it got a little busy and pushy towards the younger ones, as everyone wanted to get closer to where the foam was coming from. The inside soft play was huge and thoroughly enjoyed. Over all was a great day and would likely return.",

We find that the pick your own produce is cheaper and fresher with minimal pesticides, than the super markets, as we buy in bulk for the week. Love the natural pest control methods, fresh air and easy picking. The policies are fair and the website / boards at the entrance clearly advertise prices + pay for what you pick. Produce within the farm shop is slightly more pricey but quality is excellent. What we found most impressive is the customer service when we realised we were missing a few eggs from our boxes and had  paid for what was not in the box. We emailed the support team as we could not get through over the phone. Response was prompt and the farm over compensated us for the missing eggs. We were pleasantly surprised and very happy!

Thank you Amanda and Sadie we can’t wait to see you soon.",

          "text": "I went to Hitchin Lavender Farm yesterday and honestly, it was such a lovely experience. The moment you arrive, you’re welcomed by the calming fragrance of lavender floating through the air. The fields are absolutely stunning, rows and rows of purple stretching as far as you can see. It’s peaceful, beautiful, and just a great place to slow down and enjoy nature.\n\nThe food was a pleasant surprise too! I had a lavender ice cream cone (delicious), some lavender lemonade, and even lavender chips – which were way better than I expected. There’s also plenty of other food and drink options if lavender isn’t your thing, but if you’re up for trying something different, this is the place. Also, there’s a vegan options available.\n\nI picked up a small bag of lavender to take home for £4/- and my room smells like a spa now. We ended up chilling under the tents with a cold beer, just soaking in the vibe. The people around were super friendly and interesting, everyone seemed to be enjoying the day, and the atmosphere felt very relaxed and welcoming.\n\nOne little disappointment was that I didn’t get to enjoy the sunset, because the farm closes at 8 PM, and it would’ve been amazing to see the sun go down over those purple fields. Hopefully they’ll consider staying open a bit later during peak season.\n\nOn the practical side, the toilets were very neat and clean, which I always appreciate when you’re spending a whole day outdoors.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time and would definitely go back. It’s the kind of place that makes you want to return year after year. If you’re looking for a peaceful escape not too far, I’d definitely recommend it.",

As a family we've stayed in many places which claim to cater for families ( including some of the best 5* ones but this is by far the best yet ). They have thought of everything especially for little ones (including the toilet seats!) and for parents it is these little details - plus the fact the setting is so very beautiful and super safe - which make a holiday SO enjoyable & relaxing (not something you can often say with a toddler in tow!)\n\nIt is the perfect destination not just for families, I'd happily return just with my husband or with a group of friends for an escape or special occasion  - it is so well located for local restaurants, activities (Tapnell Farm Park is brilliant!) and great beaches plus only 10 minutes from the Ferry port.\n\nA particular shout out to both Chloe & Amanda who ensured the everything was perfect and responded to any of our needs day or night before & during our stay - THANK YOU! We will be returning.",

It was really easy with them to book. I had a great time there. The little outside fire pit was great with unlimited wood & bits you needed. Amazing presentation on arrival. I would have given it 5 stars but a few small things let it down. The cutlery and utensils were all dirty and we had to rewash them before they could be used. There was a funky smell in the bath room but that did leave after we run the shower. All in all a great time. We would 100% go again.",

We are a family with two very high energy young children aged 2 and 5 so it is nothing short of a miracle that we both actually felt relaxed after our stay here! The place was perfect for kids, they had so much fun running around, visiting the play farm. Family meals at the outdoor table, whether it was breakfast or a BBQ, was really special with the view over the hills to the sea. And the evenings in the hot tub after kids in bed were wonderful. We had a meal in the cow pub, sitting at an outdoor table and being able to relax and enjoy our meal while kids ran around the colourful cow sculptures. I hesitated to book because it is more than I would usually spend but it was worth every penny. The local area has family friendly and beautiful beaches nearby. I would highly recommend to families with young children, it is really the first holiday with them where we actually got to relax!",

We called up and booked directly with the lovely team at the lodge.  They even informed us of a special offer running the week we wanted to go.  They arranged everything for us from the bike hire to the breakfast hamper and they were so accommodating.  When we arrived the tent was spotless and warm and cosy and so welcoming.  We used the bbq and sat and watched the sunsets and took advantage of the on site restaurant which serves delicious food and there is a great happy hour in the bar!  I will definitely be booking a return trip and I highly recommend the farm and it’s perfect location.  We don’t have children but there were loads of facilities to entertain young ones and the bathrooms were so clean and well kept up. A truly magical stay and I hope it’s not too long before I return.  Thank you to all the team at Toms Eco Lodge it was wonderful xx",

It should have been light and crispy, but instead felt heavy.\n\nThe burger came with chips and the portion size was decent. I tried The Big Smoke, which was fine but not particularly memorable. What really let the dish down were the chips. They didn’t taste fresh or good quality—when you bit into them, they had hollow gaps inside instead of a fluffy, mashed potato filling.\nOn the positive side, the service was excellent. The staff were friendly, attentive, and quick to provide tap water. The restaurant itself has a cool, unique vibe, and even though it wasn’t lunchtime, I noticed people coming in to eat—so I imagine it gets lively during dinner hours.",

Free table water aswell is a fantastic touch even the lemon and lime slices were put in the correct drinks as an ex bartender this was a very nice touch that gets forgotten far to much in my opinion.

As they proudly advertise, they serve one of the tastiest burgers on the island—and they certainly live up to the claim.

Prices are reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food, and it’s a great spot for families or groups of friends looking for a satisfying meal.\n\nThe venue is clean and well-kept, with spotless toilets that reflect their attention to detail. While the food is well-priced, the cocktails are on the pricier side, which may be a small downside for those looking to pair their meal with a few drinks.\n\nNote: The Cow is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, so plan your visit accordingly.",

Huge variety of pumpkins to find and choose from, with a scarecrow hunt too! Pizza, ice cream, & coffee all available to buy when there. Just big enough for the family, but not too large to get lost in. The family were very friendly and helpful and even created a spooky shack for pictures and a laugh. Will definitely be back next year! Thanks guys!",

Additionally the pizza stand they had was delicious!\n\nFor a new pumpkin business I was highly impressed by the organisation of the patch and the dedication of the staff working. They made our day very special and we’re all very friendly and welcoming.\n\nI found that they had a super pumpkins selection and was all such a reasonable price in comparison to other patch’s I have visited in previous years.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend Erriot wood pumpkins for a spooky and wholesome day out!",

There are little wooden props and photo opportunities too, which my kids enjoyed. Good parking facilities and of reasonable value.\n\nI felt, in comparison to other large branded pumpkin patches, the value was decent and the staff were willing to measure the pumpkins fairly to get the fairest price. Of course, you can get bigger pumpkins for cheaper in supermarkets, but it's the experience and tradition that we go for.\nWe got 4 small-medium pumpkins, which will look great on our doorstep, for £14 and felt this was fine. If you're struggling for price, our tip would be to go for slimmer pumpkins over wide  flat ones. They are measured on width. But there is a guide price section at the entrance which was really helpful.\n\nMost of the pumpkins in the patch were of good quality. The second time I went, it had rained so the ground was slightly soggy but controlled well so it wasn't very muddy at all (this is the first place we've not needed wellies and puddlesuits!), and the staff were wonderful! So chatty, helpful and fair. No pushing for products but happy to discuss. It's got a wholesome and family feel to it, which would certainly make me return next year.\n\nAdditionally, we explored the garden centre which was lovely and surprisingly large, the farm shop which is well stocked, and the cafe which was beautiful (we didn't buy anything this time, but it all looked delicious, freshly made  and wa super busy meaning it's clearly a hit with the locals!).\n\nOverall we were really happy with the trip and the service received.",

That’s the reason for my 4 star rating.\nStill, I truly recommend visiting during peak bloom, it's a magical experience that stays with you. 💜",

They have the number 1 farm shop in the UK as of this year and was overall very enjoyable, however if you intend to visit this farm while it is in full bloom unfortunately you are too late to do so this year, as they have now harvested the fields.",

It was my first time visiting a lavender field, so I chose the Guided Lavender Field & Distillery Tour, hoping to learn something new.\n\nThe field was beautiful and felt quite private for photos, but the time allowed for taking pictures was a bit too short.\n\nAfter the tour, we bought another tickets to walk around the other lavender field, different type of ticket, just to take more photos, we hadn't had enough yet! Andhe flowers are only in bloom for just over a month.\n\nI tried the lavender latte, but it didn't smell like lavender at all. However, the lavender ice cream was absolutely amazing! So fragrant and delicious, we were truly impressed!\n\n💜We all had a lovely day.💜",

They even had an egg hunt activity for the kids which allowed them to meet the Easter bunny at the end of it!

Friendly helpful staff make your visit so much better. The animals appear well cared for and are friendly and enjoy the attention of the visitors.

Cuddling goats, stroking lots of animals and feeding them bliss, such a wonderful experience. There is a cafe on site if you want or a picnic area for those who want to bring a packed lunch. There are various activities available on site such as laser tag and mini golf, unfortunately the laser tag was unavailable when we visited. There are plenty of free parking spaces and an overflow car park. Very reasonable entry price 27.50 for three adults and a child with a tub of feed for the animals. There are refills of feed available at £1 a time....laser tag and golf etc cost extra and pay for as and if you use them but there is so much to do that you don't have to if you don't want to. There is a bouncy castle and bounce pillow, sand pit, nerf guns, giant darts and axe throwing.\nThey have toilets available and plenty of hand washing sites for after touching the animals. They would benefit from having more toilets available....as there was a slight wait and this was Easter holidays I feel this would be a longer wait in the height of summer.

Really appreciated the smaller “child” portion Sunday roast for those with a smaller appetite. Tasted like home cooked food. A cute farm shop and cafe, great for local produce. Bought some local eggs, local honey, and pork scratching too. Will definitely come again next time we’re driving along the M1! (Only thing that could be changed is to please refill the hand sanitiser station near the shop entrance)",

So I asked for a refund - she had to get her manager to do this.\n\nI got a refund for the pancakes, but it would have been nice if they had offered a refund for my milkshake as well.\n\nThe shop next door is very good, I bought a funny metal statue.

          "text": "For our daughter’s actual fourth birthday we took her and our two and a half year old. We spent from approx midday on a Monday until five fifteen, a good afternoon’s activity in the blistering 30 degree sun. Getting there would be difficult if not by car, parking was plenty for us on a quiet school time Monday and meant we had easy access to all activities. Not all the boutique stalls were open but understandably as it was very quiet. We started with the fun park and the kids enjoyed the train ride and the other limited spinning rides. Older kids might get a bit bored of the spinning rides but there is also crazy golf and giant bouncy pillows which  may entertain for a little while. The fun park would definitely benefit from some carefully placed trees providing some shade as well as enhancing the nature. The soft play was a good size for allowing kids to roam without the need for us to run around after them. Being amongst the farm yard though, there were lots of flies and whilst we saw the cleaning team go in after we left at kick out time, the matting seemed a little grubby and like it could all do with a thorough washing, . Cool enough in the shade but no air-con, the kids didn’t want to leave. Onto the farm yard, the kids weren’t super interested, tired by this point and have seen the usual suspects quite a few times already.  Cafe was fairly average garden centre style food, tasty enough with decent portions and so reasonable value. Overall cost of tickets for the whole family was about right, again reasonable value and a good day out for our aged kids. Potential for growth there i think in all areas and especially the fun park.",

          "text": "\" A Berry Delight at Grange Farm Harpole! \"\n\nI recently visited Grange Farm in Harpole, Northampton, and it’s hands down one of the best strawberry farms I’ve ever experienced. The place is vast, and walking through the lanes of juicy red berries was pure joy. There’s something magical about picking your own fruit—it’s fun, relaxing, and surprisingly therapeutic.\n\nI brought my parents along, and they absolutely loved it too. The farm doesn’t just offer strawberries—you’ll also find blackberries and raspberries, all ripe for the picking. You simply pluck what you want, weigh it at the end, and pay. While the prices might seem a bit on the higher side, the experience is priceless. Honestly, the joy of hand-picking fresh berries with loved ones is something money can’t measure.\n\n🚗 Plenty of free parking makes it super convenient if you’re driving. You can easily spend 1–2 hours here soaking in the countryside vibes.\n🍰 There’s a charming little café on-site too, selling delicious cookies and cakes—perfect for a post-picking treat.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend a visit to Grange Farm. Whether you’re with family or friends, it’s a wholesome outing that leaves you smiling and sticky-fingered from all the sweet berries!",

The fruit is priced reasonably (especially considering some others we have been to!) and they regularly update their facebook when they are picked out which makes it easy to plan a trip knowing there will be lots of fruit!

It's an ideal destination for families with children, offering a wonderful opportunity for a day of outdoor enjoyment. The attractions of the place include an assortment of blackberries, strawberries, and raspberries, providing a delightful experience of picking your own fresh fruits.\n\nWe chose to visit on a serene Sunday, which worked out perfectly as the crowd was minimal. Before embarking on our berry-picking adventure, we treated ourselves to a cup of coffee and a delectable brownie from the establishment itself. The combination of the warm beverage and sweet treat set the right tone for the day ahead.\n\nOne noteworthy tip for anyone planning a visit is to be mindful of sun protection. If the weather is sunny, it's advisable to wear sunscreen to ensure a comfortable and sunburn-free experience. Additionally, it's a good idea to have a jacket stashed in your car. The area can get quite chilly if the wind picks up, and having a jacket handy will ensure you're well-prepared for any unexpected weather changes.\n\nOverall, this destination is a haven for those seeking a taste of the countryside and a leisurely day outdoors. With the opportunity to pick your own berries, it's not only a fun activity but also a chance to connect with nature and savor the freshest produce. While enjoying the tranquility and natural beauty, make sure to take precautions against the elements – a dab of sunscreen and a jacket will go a long way in enhancing your experience. Whether you're looking for a family-friendly outing or a peaceful escape, this place has something wonderful to offer.",

Also, you can't walk around. You will need to turn around and walk all the way back. Even though it was a bit difficult, my daughter was amazing, and my daughter absolutely loved feeding all the animals, and she really enjoyed the play area inside after.",

Charlie has been absolutely incredible from start to finish - keeping in touch with us and answering all of our questions. On the set up day, the handover was very simple and relaxed. It’s very much a leave it as you found it and respect the area. We always wanted to do more of a DIY wedding with a festival vibe but didn’t want to have the hassle of sorting the ‘boring’ stuff like hiring tables, chairs, toilets and bins etc. All the basics are there and they are an excellent quality - once you close the door to the toilets and showers you would not believe you are in a cabin in a field. So many nice little touches like the fire pit, fairy lights and festoon lighting that provide a great backdrop for you to put your own decor with. The optional extras like the prop shop were great as well - takes the faff out of hiring things to be delivered and returned. The whole site is as eco friendly as possible which just makes the whole package even more appealing to us. We had the most wonderful day celebrating our wedding and will be forever grateful to Charlie and the team at Hadsham Farm who made it a reality for us. Thank you so much!

          "text": "We went there today for the meerkat experience and had a lovely time. Going to zoos or other places where wild animals are kept captive is always a difficult ethical dilemma for me, as a strict vegan. I always have to balance the costs against benefits and zoos do have an important role in conservation and non-threatened animals can encourage visitor numbers to generate income and resources towards supporting threatened species. Further, I do feel that people seeing live animals provides a valuable opportunity for education and by understanding the animals better, people can respect animals more in the broad sense. Anyway, the young lady from Kazakhstan was so passionate about the animals she cares for and so very knowledgeable about the meerkats - a credit to her profession and just the kind of person that should be advocating for these animals. They have one meerkat being kept alone, which isn't ideal as they are a highly social species. However, she provided a clear rationale for how this is in the animal's best interest, given she was being ostracized by other group members. The birds of prey talk was also really interesting and the keeper also seemed passionate about the animals in his care. Ultimately, the animals seemed well cared for and by people that are passionate about their welfare, which made me feel somewhat better about my decision to contribute financially to what is being done there.",

The one in the office was excellent.\nMaybe an old fashion maid calling system in the rooms to pull , push to set off a recorded talk or a type of hand held radio to carry,  to hear the history.. Or activities to participate in.\nThe café was ok and reasonably priced. A good mug of tea!\nCan’t say we didn’t enjoy it as we are both enthusiastic about keeping history alive. We also realise the cost of upkeep is difficult. But sometimes, making it more affordable or more enticing, could encourage more paying visitors..Speculating to accumulate.\nWe wish you all well, hoping for more success for the future",

The grounds are a good size and easily adaptable for a short stroll around the kitchen garden or can be made longer to cover the orchards and meadows. There are chickens and geese freely roaming as well as sheep and goats in the paddocks. The house itself is amazing and every room had the wow factor. This is certainly one of the best dressed homes we have visited. The reception staff were friendly and there’s a nice little shop. There were sadly no staff in the house which meant we couldn’t ask questions, however plenty of informative signage.\n\nFree parking as well!",

I have been to the farm and shop a couple of times before but a couple of issues this time mean we probably won't return. We did enjoy an ice cream while we wandered round the animals and garden centre. The farm shop left us disappointed overall, the ham we had was wonderful as was the cheesecake pot, other items such as the sticky toffee pudding (dry and lacking sauce) and onion bhaji were far less impressive. The main issue for us was the cheese we purchased from the deli. I chose a few items that were 50% off as we intended to have them for dinner that evening. The cheeses still seemed relatively expensive (despite us being regulars as Paxton and Whitfield and knowing what a good cheese should cost). When I questioned the price, I was reassured that the discount has been applied however when I weighed a couple of the cheeses at home it was evident this was not the case. The cheeses were very good but cost me considerably more than they should have. Millets has a lot to offer but unfortunately our shoppkng experience would not encourage us to return.",

A farm shop that’s a must to visit and an outdoor play area too. Animal petting and a real connection with nature for the kids. It’s set back, private and it feels like it’s in the middle of nowhere. An amazing spot. I had five grandchildren there and they all had the best time. The food was amazing, really good portions and lovely coffee. The entry prices are pleasantly surprising compared to other petting farms and the biggest plus is that the staff are all absolutely lovely. They’re a credit. I’m really looking forward to getting back there soon.",

Excellent cup of coffee, plus the bonus of a farm shop, and you should follow signs for farm shop parking, as the other parking is for the visitors who are attending the children's attractions of which there were many, and I was amazed by the number of things they could do. Have to pay an entrance fee to use the attractions, but particularly the tractor tour, when I was there looked very popular.\nCoffee shop and restaurant had lots of seating and a variety of food to choose from and an indoor play area at the end. The farm shop was small but perfectly formed and was a bonus as it had some items I've not seen in other similar establishments, and so purchased a couple of items to take home. Sadly, their own home made pies, which were good value and looked very tasty were frozen, and would have defrosted by time we got home, but if passing through the area on way home would definitely stop and get some.\nDefinitely Recommended.",

Always a wonderful experience, the kids absolutely love being able to wander around the fields and choose from the wide range of different coloured pumpkins. We always choose a few different varieties and leave happy with a good amount, that are so fairly priced! I don't think we've ever spent more than around £20 and have had a good pile of pumpkins outside our door each year. Took our friends with us last year and they loved the patch too, and we picked up a couple for them this year as they were too busy to make it themselves. It's a 40 minute trip for us each way, but we think it's well worth it for the experience, not to mention that if you go on the right day they have market stalls set up from lots of small businesses so it's the ideal time to get some gift shopping done!

Grabbed a table outside in the courtyard and ordered food. A few tables down had a plague of wasps enjoying a left over drink, as soon as I opened my drink we were also being buzzed around. I suggested the waitress boil the kettle and pour it into the wasp soup to try and solves or help the problem. She decided to just pic and glass of wasps up and move it to a different position and then pour cold water into the glass which sent the wasps into a frenzy. We requested if as a 1 off could we go inside with our dog which was granted on this occasion.  The food and service was really good and a decent price.\nWe then wanted to visit the farm shop.. no dogs allowed unless its a service dog..\nShame tbf, and baffling as so many other garden centres allow dogs on leads anywhere within their establishments. Purely on that basis we wont be returning as the establishment is not dog friendly but is happy to offer a 45 minute use of and enclosed field for £8. Real shame and bizarre for a farm where generally all of gods creatures should be welcome.",

It was with this knowledge that I happily invested £30 in a sizable bounty of these local delights. Each strawberry was a ruby red jewel, plump and fragrant, promising the taste of English summer at its peak.\n\nThe service matched the excellence of the produce. The lady who assisted us was not only proficient in her role but also attuned to the nuances of customer service. With a knowing smile, she interpreted the silent request for clotted cream, a perfect companion to our strawberry feast. Her discretion and understanding of this unspoken ‘code’ added a layer of personal touch and humor to our shopping experience.\n\nHer jovial nature made our visit not just a transaction, but a joyous exchange. It's encounters like these – full of warmth and shared smiles – that transform routine stops into memorable highlights of one's day.\n\nWarren's Farm Shop, with its quality produce and amiable staff, has earned my utmost recommendation. Whether you're passing through or a local in search of the finest fruits of the land, do not bypass the chance to visit. You'll leave not just with bags full of the best Cheddar strawberries but also with a lingering sense of delight from the service received.",

Took us 35 mins small maze and 50 mins large maze. You can collect stamps across both mazes to keep kids engaged and there is a small prize at the end. BEAUTIFUL cafe at the entrance, reasonable priced. Good looks incredible. Amazing views from the cafe looking out to the walks. All in a great value day out.",

The activities, rides, and play areas are perfect for under 12s, and my preschooler absolutely loved it.\n\nThat said, it’s not ideal for teens, as there isn’t much to keep older kids entertained for long. Also, the pricing felt a bit unfair — my preschooler had to pay the same price as an adult, which was the only real downside of the visit.\n\nOther than that, it was a lovely day, the park is well maintained, and we’d definitely go again!",

It didn't disappoint and I actually quite enjoyed being alone in the rooms with just me and my children, especially as it's my youngest son's first Christmas this year, it just made it a bit more personal and special, Santa was great and really took the time to get to know the kids and spend a bit time with us and all children came away with a gift suitable for their age.

The café is linked to the farm shop which sells local produce to support local farms. It is all very high quality especially the butchers here the meat is very tasty 😋.

We had our kids there, aged three and six as well as their grandparents and I’m happy to say that we all enjoyed our time there.\n\nThere were small clear baskets for free to pick fruits and vegetables and then there were these sturdier baskets for only a pound each that we could take home. There was a huge field, and each area had its designated produce.\n\nAfter picking your own berries, you go to the little barn and pay for what you picked. The prices were really reasonable, and everything we picked was amazing. We got potatoes, spinach, Carrots, and of course, strawberries. And honestly, they are like 100 times better than the store-bought ones.\n\nI would highly recommend this place for picking your own/excellent quality produce.

          "text": "We had a lovely experience today at Hogshaw Farm. 2 adults. 2 chdn under 10. There is so much to do and to see. For £15 pp there's 2 sand pits, multiple play areas, water play area (within one sand area), farm animals and some wildlife animals. We pre booked the bird show (free) and the woman who presented really knew her info and made it really interesting! She spent some time answering my sons questions too. We didn't eat there but the cafe was huge and had a massive soft play inside. Toilets situated at the beginning. Loads of places to sit and eat. Small train ride and bouncy pillows x 2 for under 5s and 5 plus. All the staff were really really friendly and I can't fault them at all! Would highly recommend for a day out in the sun as it's all outdoors apart from cafe n shop.",

Each time you visit there has been a new addition or an upgrade and you can see the passion that they put into making this farm and amazing place to visit! Every day there are numerous animal feeds or talks and all of these are interactive and educational. Eva, who often does these talks when I visit has a wealth of knowledge and clearly knows these animals on a very personal level, telling us quirks of each animals personality. There's a lovely little cafe there with reasonably priced food and regular events through the school holidays as well! Their annual tickets are very reasonably priced and we even found out today that for £8.60 on top of your standard entry, you can get a summer pass, allowed unlimited free entry through the summer holidays!!",

The café is lovely too - we had afternoon tea for the adults, and some duck salad and a pasta for our teens. Everything was great - we sat on the terrace, enjoying the view as well as the food. There were three generations at our table and we were all very happy with our experience - lots of space to park and easy access to the tables; helpful staff; and a lovely view to enjoy our wonderful sweet and savoury treats. We then picked up some steaks and sausages for the barbecue which I'm cooking now, and I can tell they'll be delicious (I've bought some before) - high quality meat.

Seating was either the standard outdoor seating benches, or on the field behind the Shack, either on the grass, a couple of benches or a couple of haybales.\n\nFood on offer was very limited: two vans, HitWrap and one that was making either a meat burger or a veggie burger, I think from the farm shop produce. It was a huge shame more local produce was not available for purchase. This was clearly falsely advertised, as the advert states \"Guests can indulge in a variety of offerings, a BBQ serving up fire-cooked seasonal delights, and a selection of local food trucks.\"\n\nThe shops closed at their normal hours, so it was not possible to browse through these. The Shack was abysmal. A sign pointed towards it offering \"Dessert and Ice Cream,\" but all that was on offer was a nearly £10 \"sundae\" or small slices of flapjack/brownie costing £3.70. The person serving was not particularly happy to see customers.\n\nThere was a jazz type band playing when we arrived around 5pm. When they ended it was a DJ. Both were nice, but just background music rather than entertainment.\n\nThe most ironic thing of all was that the portaloos were placed exactly where the sun was setting! Not an ideal location for an evening literally named the \"Sundowner\"!!\n\nTo be honest, I'm not really sure what we paid £12.50 per person for.",

Spent a small fortune of a variety of foods from the Farm Shop, some Tallow & Ash from The Barn Shop and then into The Hollies Takeaway for a delicious breakfast bap for my husband, latte and then a still cloudy lemonade for myself which was the best still lemonade I’ve ever had. We sat outside under the shade because even though it was only 10am (we arrived just after 8.30am on a Sunday morning) it was beautiful and warm. Ideal day out if you’re into farm shops and produce. We drove down from Liverpool , and the drive is great. Afterwards we took a scenic route home. Will definitely have a drive over again soon ❤️",

While there weren’t many strawberries or other berries available for picking at the time, we still really enjoyed walking around the farm and taking in the fresh air.\n\nThe staff were friendly, and the overall experience was relaxing and fun, especially for the kids.

They have plants, miniature railway, playground with a little food van which does breakfast rolls and pizza later on.\nWe had a wander around the farm shop, we couldn't buy too much unfortunately as we are staying in a hotel. The meat looks lovely, so much choice. Lots of baked goods too, I brought a cherry and apricot flapjack.\nWe decided to have brunch so we went to the cafe, they were busy inside so we had a choice to sit outside (a little windy summers day) or wait for a table to come free. We were pressed for time so we decided to brave the wind. It was quick service, again a good choice of food.  I had a fab hot chocolate and the hot buttery cinnamon toast, I'll be honest I wasn't expecting much. When it came out It looked so good, two doorstop sized multi grain toast covered in a sweet cinnamon butter. It was delicious, even my other half who wouldn't go near multi grain bread said he would have eaten that. It's definitely for someone with a sweet tooth. My other half had the lighter breakfast which he enjoyed, bacon was his favourite.\nI would have loved to come back for a Sunday roast or a pizza but I'm at the end of my holiday now so will save it in my maps for next time.",

First stop was the cafe which at peak times can get busy and reservations are not needed, however there can be a significant wait time and for that they give you a buzzer for when your table will be ready.The site has other things to do such as the farm shop with some freshly made food from the farm. I had the black pudding sausage roll and it was bloody delicious. Prices amongst the shop can be a reach but considering the freshness and effort, it's worth it in the end.Calderbarn also has a miniature train ride, small park for kids and a doggy park (bookings only). Plenty of parking and seating available. If you're in the area or passing by, it's definitely a stop to add. Wouldn't recommend it for a full day out but as a lunch stop, highly recommended.",

We used to love this little farm café, it was always such a quaint spot with lovely friendly staff. Sadly, it seems to have expanded (possibly changed hands) and has lost its charm. The atmosphere felt cold, staff weren’t friendly or helpful, and our order was wrong. We had to ask multiple times just to return our incorrect drinks, weren’t given any cutlery, and the menu had very few options. On top of that, it was surprisingly expensive for what we got. They claim to be dog friendly but only had a few umbrellas outside in the hot weather and didn’t appear to have any water for them. Really disappointed, especially as it used to be one of our favourite places and we were excited to make it our regular now we’re back in the area. Unfortunately we won’t be returning.",

You can see they have lots of other fruits growing which aren't ready just yet !\n\nOn the site next door there is a really decent café (breakfast was amazing) there's also a huge farm shop, crazy golf, goats and an outdoor play area for the kids !\n\nThese strawberries and raspberries are miles better than the supermarket rubbish we normally buy, they taste so much nicer, very juicy and taste super fresh as they've just been picked :-) haha\n\nWe paid £13 for the medium sized bucket and filled it with plenty of fruit, much cheaper than the supermarket aswell as we've got tonnes of good quality yummy fresh fruit !!\n\nWe would happily go again and would defo recommend it to other people :-)",

The farm shop has some delicious food for us to cook in our pod.\nWe live locally but wanted a peaceful weekend and we got it. I would recommend the pods to anyone who needs some time out in their own or as a couple for some relaxation or just to unwind with the children.\nWe will definitely be back again soon.",

I do wish there were some fish and more vegetarian options, but they carry some wonderful local brands which I love to see.

It really was a beautiful place, and worth seeing, but £7 per person to walk in a field for an hour seemed expensive...",

We had two older teenagers and one younger as well as four adults and we had a great day.\n\nThe animals were clearly very well cared for and plenty of staff were working to keep them cleaned out and looked after.\n\nThe facilities were clean and well kept including a LOT of adventure play equipment. If bringing smaller ones I recommend allowing plenty of time for your visit as you will likely be spending plenty of time here!\n\nHighly advise booking in advance as a premium is charged for paying on the door!",

We also saw the milking demonstration which was informative.\nThere are lots of outdoor parks, swings, tractors to play on. But also an indoor soft play, which is large but be cautious the area is split by age but the small ones can get to the older area.\nWe are sad this farm is far away from us but will definitely be returning if we head out that way.\nThanks Rand Farm",

Excellent - pretty busy, but we got a table straight away, the food was very good, service extremely efficient. Refreshed, we walked off our lunch around the sculpture gardens. Including an indoor exhibition there are some 300 works exhibited - we probably saw them all (took photos of about 100 or so!). There is something about seeing sculpture in the outdoors, the way it is juxtaposed against the natural world, which enhances most works, and this was a very impressive collection. (And there is a wealth of information on the website, it has been extremely well put together.) To conclude our visit we spent more than we should have done in the impressive and high-end farm shop - the locally-produced apple juice and the little yellow Mirabel plums grown in the gardens definitely recommended. Couple of things to note: the sculpture exhibition is only on until 7 September, and the RHS and Gardener's World discounts which are usually valid do not apply as normal during the exhibition (apparently there have been ructions at the ticket desk, so this is an advance warning!) We didn't visit the hall, so can't comment on that (looks impressive though) and without the sculpture exhibition - which is only there for a few weeks - the grounds would be a different type of experience. So we may well come back to see how it all works!",

Go to the small shop and pick up a bucket and they will also let you know where to pick.\n\nFor the picking itself, there were so many fresh blueberries. My family was able to pick to their hearts desire and didn’t even make a dent.\n\nThe shop was run by a very friendly worker that weighed the blueberries for the price. We also purchased blueberry juice and local honey. The blueberry juice was refreshing. I haven’t tried the honey yet.\n\nIt is a well run farm and my son already wants to go back. Highly recommend!",

They were always quick to respond to our questions, extremely helpful with planning details, and nothing ever felt like too much trouble. In the months leading up to the wedding, they gave us such confidence that everything would run smoothly, and on the day itself they went above and beyond to make sure it did.\n\nThe venue itself is simply beautiful – the perfect setting for a summer wedding. It felt both elegant and relaxed, with a warm and welcoming atmosphere that our guests loved. We had many comments from family and friends about how lovely the venue was and how well everything was organised.\n\nOne of the things I appreciated most was how accommodating the team were with our personal touches. I had made lots of decorations myself, and the staff were more than happy to take them and set everything up on the day. It meant I didn’t have to worry about a thing – I could just enjoy the morning knowing everything was being taken care of. When we arrived, the room looked stunning and exactly how we’d pictured it.\n\nOn the day, James and his staff worked tirelessly to make sure everything ran seamlessly. Their attention to detail, professionalism, and hard work really stood out. They managed the timings perfectly, looked after our guests so well, and created a relaxed, stress-free atmosphere for us as a couple. It honestly felt like we were in such safe hands the entire time.\n\nWe are so grateful to everyone at the Dovecote Buttery for giving us such a perfect reception. It was everything we’d hoped for and more. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that combines excellent organisation, a beautiful setting, and a truly dedicated team, we couldn’t recommend them highly enough.",

Our first visit had us feeling a bit let down because we didn’t know we needed to book the reindeer walk online, but the fantastic family owners went above and beyond to accommodate us. They invited us back during the week for a magical reindeer experience, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint!\n\nThe farm is transformed into a Christmas wonderland with a charming shop stocked with delightful holiday decorations, and there's a food and drink cart with tasty snacks and delicious hot chocolate. They had an impressive selection of Christmas trees in all shapes and sizes at fantastic prices, plus some exotic trees that reminded us of the tropical trees back home.\n\nOn the day of our much-anticipated reindeer walk, we faced a little hiccup when the tour guide had to handle a family obligation, but we made the most of it by running errands and grabbing a late lunch before heading back. When we finally embarked on the reindeer tour, we were met by a friendly and enthusiastic male guide who captivated us with fascinating stories about the reindeer, the farm animals, and the joys of farm life.\n\nMeeting the reindeer, Storm, and Blizzard was incredible! Feeding them was an unforgettable experience, and we were delighted to have a cute little hen join in on the fun. We couldn't believe how quickly she approached us, eager for attention! Storm and Blizzard were at first a bit more reserved. Seeing the fur on their antlers and marveling at their mass was fascinating. The reindeer walking path was beautifully illuminated to include a beautiful moonlighting at the time, making our stroll through the farm a magical experience.\n\nOur family had an absolute blast interacting with all the animals, and we're already counting down the days until we can visit again next year, hopefully with some exciting new additions! Thank you to the Perry family for their warm hospitality and for creating such a memorable experience. Wishing Perry Tree Farm a spectacular future filled with thrilling adventures in 2025 and beyond. Happy Christmas/Felis Pasgua! From our family to yours.",

The animals were very friendly and happy to see you (especially the sheep and goats when they saw the feed bucket). The highlight for me were the horses and they were absolutely beautiful. I’ve seen comments regarding the welfare and condition of the animals but I didn’t see a single animal I was concerned about. The horses were in great condition and the CPL of one mare was being managed well and the sweet itch (which is very common) of a pony gelding was immediately picked up on. Similarly, the other animals such as the cattle were also kept in great condition and plenty of hay and clean water was in the paddocks. Even animals I don’t know much about such as the rabbits and guinea pigs all had fresh food, water and bedding alongside looking clean and healthy themselves.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and talkative and included us in a number of activities. One we particularly enjoyed was feeding the cows jam sandwiches!\nOne of my friends also lost her favourite cardigan which they very kindly found for her and we were able to retrieve it.\n\nAs for the other facilities, I cannot complain at all and we enjoyed an ice cream outside at the end of our day.

Exception to the rule was the goose.. the cobra chickens woke up choosing violence - as a Canadian, I expected.. so no harm, no fowl..\n\nThe bucket of feed was well priced, and the animals were very food motivated - they loved saying hi!  There were a vast variety of farm animals. It is a proper working farm.\n\nThe staff were kind and delightful! There is a small cafe in the building and the food was DELICIOUS!\n\nThere is no negative thing I could say about it.  Had an amazing experience here.

The ground is unsuitable for a wheelchair with narrow wheels due to the stones on the tracks and the totally unsuitable ramps going in/out of the cafe/entrance.\nWe couldn't use the disabled loo either, because a workers van had blocked the gate entrance.\nOther than that we still had a lovely time there.\nWe all considered that the entrance fee rather high for a small farm and will go elsewhere in the future.",

The small café, the scenic garden seating area, and the fairly large parking lot are all very nice features. However, the layout of the fields seemed a bit disorganized and careless to me. You can’t tell which fruit is where without walking around a lot, which can be tiring. There should be signs between the fields to help with directions. Also, I found it a bit expensive. Another thing is, while picking fruits, you naturally end up eating some, but apparently eating while picking is not allowed. Still, we mentioned the ones we had eaten at the checkout, and they responded kindly by saying “That’s fine.” Thank you for your efforts and service and kidness. 🍓🍓🍓🍓",

Normally they do breakfast in the main house early but as we were at the wedding he offered us breakfast in the farm shop instead up until 11.30 which was great so we could lie in.  He was also easy with our check out time which was helpful.  The cottage had stunning views and all the amenities we needed as well as parking.  It was spacious, had a King Size bed and a fully equipped kitchen with cooker and hob.

This farm is free entry with donations welcomed what an amazing thing for Sheffield council to do. The staff were all so friendly. The farm is really well set out. There was lamb feeding and the option to buy feed for the other animals, the Highland cow was extremely gentle when eating out of my hand. The farm is a real asset set in a beautiful park.

I would like to see a choice of what to donate like £1 or £2. Some families may not be able to afford the suggested donation. There is a churn inside that you can drop cash in if you have it on you. This park is huge. I only visited the animal and play parks with my grandchildren. There are picnics seating tables inside the animal park. The animal feed is £1.50 to buy and signs around, saying which animals can be fed. You can visit the Rose garden cafe for food/drink.  You can make this day as cheap or expensive as you like. The park also hosts events.",

However after us ordering separately and the person cooking screaming out that we wouldn’t get our food brought out together and if we wanted that then we should’ve ordered together (for the record we didn’t ask or expect it to come out together, nor were we bothered, it was just the lady taking the orders saying that we were sat together)  she then proceeded to throw things around the kitchen and bang about clearly making the other staff uncomfortable. We could see this as there are two doors into the kitchen, this would also explain the lack of care when making the food and it looking like it had been thrown on the plate. Now I had my 1 year old with me, she should not have experienced this. This lady needs some re-training or a job where she is away from people and her temper cannot affect anyone. Her collegue told us to ‘just ignore her’ so she is clearly like this regularly and the other staff member looked very nervous being around her and kept out of her way. Extremely unprofessional even though she calmed down after something was mentioned. If she was a member of my staff she’d have to receive disciplinary action.\nThe two stars are for the other member of staff who took our orders and that it seems like a quaint little garden centre.",

Don’t let the queue put you off; it’s well worth the 10-15 minute wait.\n\nAll the food is fresh, locally sourced, and of fantastic quality. It isn’t cheap, but you should expect to pay a premium when the produce is this excellent.\n\nEventually, once they had a table for us, we ordered. We initially wanted four lamb and mint sandwiches, but when they couldn’t accommodate that, we changed our order to one lamb, two beef, and one prawn sandwich. They apologized and even gave us four free scones as a lovely gesture.\n\nNot long after we were seated, our food arrived—about 10 minutes later—and it was delightful. Each sandwich came with its own salad and crisps. The tea was lovely too, with each of us getting our own pot.\n\nThe place is a real gem—the carrot cake and caramel tart were incredible.\n\nThe only downside was the toilets; they could use a refresh, but everywhere else is excellent. The on-site bakery and butcher are also worth a visit, and the butcher’s prices are slightly cheaper since there’s no VAT.\n\nThe car park is massive, though I imagine it gets packed easily.\n\nThe bottom line is that you need to visit—it’s brilliant!",

They also had a lovely selection of plants to purchase and also fruit plants too. Mick also showed us where the bee hives were and we bought some honey made right on the farm from the very same bees that were buzzing about the farm. Mick recommended blending the blackcurrants and having them on ice cream and we did just this this evening, and it was amazing!! My daughter loved it too.

It’s packed with engaging experiences for children, with both indoor fun and, most importantly, a fantastic outdoor area to explore.\n\nOne of the highlights is the variety of farm animals, which the kids absolutely loved. They even had the chance to pet some of the guinea pigs and rabbits — such a sweet, hands-on experience.\n\nWe purchased a summer ticket, so we’re planning to visit at least once every weekend. It’s one of the best ways we’ve found to keep the kids entertained, active, and happy.\n\nOur children especially enjoy the outdoor soft play area and the toddler rides, which run until 4 PM and are always a big hit.

Asked about food at 11.30, got told it would be 10 more minutes. Asked about food again at 11.50, got told it would be 10 more minutes. Food arrived at 12.10pm. Saw other tables come, be fed, and leave in that time. As I said, we’d done a preorder to make it easier and they still got 1 meal wrong, 1 meal which was burnt with a cold fried egg on top, and 1 meal that just wasn’t made and was missing.\n\nStaff were polite and helped with what they could. They mentioned they were a chef down, however all the tables were full. If there is a chef down, tables should be limited so that a good quality of service can still be given. It’s better to have half a cafe leave happy, than have an entire cafe be irritated, ask for refunds due to poor timing and food, and go away with a negative experience.\n\nThe farm shop was lovely and had a great selection of gluten free food, which was great",

Whilst the animal element is more limited than we are used to when visiting a 'farm', the vast play areas certainly provided more than enough entertainment. The pedal area is amazing, my girls would have stayed in there for hours exploring all the different modes of transport. The offering of animals were small but we still enjoyed visiting them all, especially the baby animals in the indoor section. Parking was plentiful and whilst we didn't eat at the cafe, the coffee was good and the menu looked varied. I would definitely recommend this place to others.\n\nFinally, my one gripe when it comes to pricing (and many many places do it) is why is it the same cost for adults to enter the farm as it is a child? As much as I enjoyed the day, I definitely didn't get to interact with everything like my children did!",

We’ll definitely be back this summer!\n\nIt’s basically loads of playgrounds, sand play, a soft play, a trampoline park and ride-on toys all in one place plus animals and a beautiful natural setting.  We packed a picnic and spent 6 hours here with an 8yo, 5yo and 2yo.  There’s loads of picnic tables in the sun and in the shade.\n\nThe barn was a huge draw for my children who loved looking at the animals multiple times throughout the day.  The kids (baby goats) and piglets were super cute and the farm staff working in the barn was happy to chat and give us some more info.  On a hot day (28 degrees) the barn and soft play felt quite cool.\n\nWe stopped at the tea room for ice cream and coffee, and I thought it was lovely that they had toys you could bring to the table and colouring.\n\nAll the staff we encountered were lovely, the other families were lovely and children were just enjoying themselves— running, jumping, climbing and getting sandy! Definitely child friendly and Autistic friendly, as there is so much to do it doesn’t feel overcrowded even on a busy day.  Lots of parking, although only two blue badge spaces I noticed, but we still managed to park close.",

Every staff member we encountered was so polite and helpful, we were given a very warm welcome from the guy at the ticket box. We took a packed lunch so didnt eat the hot foods, but the cafe section was great with loads of choice. The biscoff cookie slice was amazing and it was refreshing to be given a huge slab of sweet treat for £3.90 rather a small finger slice like most places.\nDo agree the soft play could do with a wash and a revamp. The baby section wasn't very engaging. The animals were all inside when we went which meant we saw them well but wasn't really sure why this was foe thw middle of a dry day.\nHuge play area outside with tons to choose from. Would definitely say this dominates over the animals so if you have a child who loves to climb balance and jump this is the great place to choose.",

You can watch the animals and eat your food at the same time which i think is genius. The food was tasty, nicely cooked and crispy. Flavours were there and the portions were good sizes. There's a water station inside for you to fill your cups up whenever you like which is good to save you having to ask. Menu has a wide range of options, including vegan and vegetarian. Kid friendly as well with options for them too.",

Our three tiered plate of sandwiches, quiche, cakes and a pot of tea for two arrived and it was truly delicious. However, unlike the many other places we've enjoyed afternoon tea at, that was it. Nothing was replenished, no extra sandwiches or anything, not even the advertised refillable pot of tea was offered as it turned out. We are not greedy people, we had enjoyed what we were given and thought it was excellent value for money. Unfortunately though, when I went to pay the bill and I handed my voucher over I was shocked to be asked for a further £19.90 on top. I didn't make a fuss, I just paid up and left. When we got home, I did something I should have done and that was to check things out on the Denstone Hall Farm Shop website. Sure enough, there is a lovely picture of what we'd had but, that picture shows not what one person will be served, that is what two people get for £39.90. So, look carefully at the picture, divide it by two and judge for yourself if that is good value for money.",

We did the 1-hour alpaca walk, which was such a fun and unique experience – my child absolutely loved it. The alpacas were gentle and well looked after, and the staff were friendly and helpful throughout.\n\nAfter the walk, we stayed for lunch, which was delicious and great quality. It’s a lovely place for all ages – perfect for both young kids and older generations. A great way to spend the day together as a family. Highly recommend!",

We stayed to have a look around the rest of the farm after. I definitely recommend as a family day out - whether it's just for a look around, or if you're booking one of the experience packs. There's play areas for the kids, plus a really cool bouncy castle/trampoline kind of area (if only I was still a child!), and a cafe to grab a drink/bite to eat.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the car park could be better signed. Just to make it more obvious that the car park is specifically for willow tree farm, and not the seemingly abandoned school. Once parked, we didn't have any issues finding where to go.\n\nI would definitely go again!",

          "text": "We have just came back from our visit at the willow tree farm and feel a tad disappointed.\n\nAfter reviewing their website to see how colourful and informative it was we (3x adults) were really excited to visit. Upon visiting we were a little confused over car parking as there was no signs directing you to their car park and instead looks like an abandoned school car park. When we entered the farm we were a little lost on where to start and go as there was no directions and no map given (which may be useful for the future). After walking down we noticed the event tent and was confused to find 4 sheep randomly sat but came along running for food, we headed back to the cafe (which was the entrance and exit to the farm) to ask about food to be informed “we have ran out of food and don’t know when it will be delivered” we headed back out to continue on our trek round. We found an empty pig pen, one goat throwing around an empty food bucket trying to get food to then move on to chew what was of little grass, whilst the other goats were looking at people for food, we noticed a few visitors feeding them grass. We found a lot of animals didn’t seem used to human contact whereas some only looked at you for food. We then entered the reptile room and found what we thought was a cupboard that was labelled “please shut behind you” which was left opened when visitors were in and out to find a few further animals in there. The medical area/sheep pen next door we found to be dirty and lonely.\n\nIt seemed to me personally the care and attention was focused on all the play areas for children rather than the hospitality and care for the animals. The shame was also there was no information on the animals no signs to say whether the animals had names or any information about them for example was there llamas or alpacas or both? 😂",

A few places to take photos, but that's more for the adults to make themselves feel better about spending silly amount on pumpkins, ice-cream and £2.50 for a can of fizzy pop (I took my own).\n\nFacilities were bad too.

I did expect to be picking pumpkins off the vines themselves tbh but I've never attended a pumpkin picking event before. The kids did enjoy they activities and sitting on the tractor and wagon too. A few of the little gourds were broken so they couldn't play the gourd and spoon race but they enjoyed the rest of the activities and had fun. Lots of different sized pumpkins for everyone. The scary tunnel was fun and the displays were awesome. We liked the scarecrows made by local school children and voting for them too. Only thing I might add for next year is maybe a petting zoo for the kids as my children were excited to see a sheep over the fence. It would definitely be the icing on the cake but overall we enjoyed the whole event. Definitely reasonably priced too.",

We spent 4 hours and could have been there longer! Incredible attention to detail and fun for all ages at such a reasonable price point. If there’s tickets left be quick and book- you won’t be disappointed. Thank you for an afternoon we’ll treasure forever!",

You have to mind the dates of availability though and arrive within the time slot assigned. Advanced booking is definitely a plus!\n\nWe came about 45 minutes early for our booking, but the staff at the entrance kindly allowed us in.\n\nWe don't own a car, and have googled maps the bus route for getting to the place but the easiest solution was an Uber from the city centre which didn't break the bank as well!\n\nWhen you get to the place, they have a huge parking lot and an entry area where they had inflatable play spaces for kids of all ages and a teacup ride for the littler guests. Porta potties were also made available, and that made me feel really at ease.\n\nComing into the open space before the sunflower field, there was a recreational and picnic area where there were food trucks that served burgers, and ones that sold ice cream and hot drinks! They had a tent at the end as well with booths that offered burgers, cookies and pastries, and even a magic show!\n\nOpposite to the picnic area, there were booths for facepainting and caricature drawings, and a reaaaaalllly big beach chair you can sit on for a gigantic photo op!\n\nBefore you entered the field premises there was a booth that allowed parents to take photos of their tiny tots as a precaution in case they got lost (which can easily happen - the field is huuuuge!). Children must come accompanied by adults!\n\nThey also offered to lend shears for cutting thr sunflowers incase you wanted to bring some with you - they only cost £1 per piece, which is a bargain as they are soooo freakin' huge!\n\nDefinitely one of the highlights of my summer! Hope to come again next year!! 🥰\n\nThank you! We've had an awesome time!!",

We ordered two sandwiches and two drinks. The drinks arrived very quickly but the sandwiches took over an hour to come out and when they did they were fine but the wedges on the side were so dry, there was very little potato in the centre and I almost chipped a tooth on them. It was as if they had been left on the warmer all day to dry out. Considering the wait for sandwiches I would have thought the staff would have apologised for the delay or at least forewarned us. I would have also assumed considering the +30°C temperatures they would have tried to upsell some more drinks to us but they didn't come near us until the food arrived.\n\nWe then went into the shop and bought something at the butchers and some  bread rolls. We had heard good things about the shop and cafe, so I assume we caught them on a bad day.  But overall this was a very disappointing visit. I've been to so many similar shops and cafes who do a really great job so this just wasn't up to par for me. The women at the till in the shop was super friendly and chatty and gave some advice on things to do in the area though. Can't fault her.",

I had scampi and chips and my husband had fish cakes.  Both of our dinners had chips which were barely warm, peas which I would say were like bullets, salad which looked sad and limp, plates were stone cold.  The fishcakes were acceptable but the scampi was overcooked, so for the pleasure of 2 edible fishcakes and 2 milkshakes we paid just short of £50.00.  I complained to one of the staff who spoke to a manager who basically said because I had eaten the scampi, which I hasten to add was a real challenge, that I should have complained in the beginning.  How do you do that before you have tasted the food?  It was obvious from the whole plateful of food which was left that there was an issue.  DISMISSED entirely with a conversation of when you come back maybe we can do better.  Really!!!!  Would I ever want to go back.   NO",

The animals were lovely, clearly well fed as they didn’t want to eat the pellets we bought🤣\nThe only things I would say it that please can you cut the donkey hedge down, our little ones couldn’t see them even when we picked them up, and I had to go on tiptoes!",

The tractor ride, jumping pillows, maize maze, arts & crafts, and seeing the farm animals were all big highlights. The café is great, tasty food, local ice creams, and we even took home some chocolate oatey. You can pretty much sit anywhere and still see your children from a distance, making it safe while allowing them some independence. We arrived at 10am and stayed until 4:30pm, you can easily spend a whole day here. It’s very well priced, especially compared to other attractions in Norfolk, and the staff are super friendly.

For days I’d been looking forward to that strawberry tart and I was momentarily disappointed when there were none on display.\n\nHolly and Eleanor went the extra mile when they found a strawberry tart for me in the play barn cafe whilst I enjoyed a coffee with our new addition and my husband played with the kids in the softplay - birthday bliss! 🍓🍰\n\nIt was a really kind thing to do - thank you girls!

Although the entrance is bad for about a truck's length, the concrete road is good after that. I also saw a few nice agricultural machines that caught my eye. I would be happy to return here if they order me to load here. It seemed like a quiet, peaceful area. There are birds chirping nicely in the landscape. Unfortunately, the weather was not favorable, but this is typical in England. I had to wait for the goods. However, they were willing to meet me on time. They showed me the restroom and the dining room themselves. There is a nice gentleman in the office. His handwriting is extremely neat. His voice and intonation are pleasant to my ears, like that of a dubbing actor. They offered me coffee, while he turned to the technology without agonizing over the difference between the languages. Waiting in my truck, they knock once. The boss asks me to open the curtain, the show begins. The forklift drivers are skilled and helpful.\nThen, after loading, the boss looked for a way to fix the fixing and did so.\n\nThank you again for everything!\nSee you later",

Other wee entertainment bits like an Alice in wonderland theme walk through scenes…bit creepy imo but there for Easter as far as I could tell.\n\nRabbits, Guinea pigs, tortoises, sheep, goats, pigs.\nMusic room and a sort of science room which our toddler didn’t engage with much - better for the older children with those interests.\n\nTractor trailer ride, barrel train all running v smoothly!\n\nOutside assault course, play park, diggers x2 (£1), electric tractors (£1), shed/small house play bits, space hopper field, Iron Age roundhouse, pig racing, staff put on a fun rabbit (fancy dress) race for entertainment.\n\nWe didn’t use the cafe much but we did get a hot chocolate, cake and ice creams - service was ok. Didn’t really want to stay or go back for that tbh.\n\nThe staff with the tractor rides and the animals were lovely, couldn’t have been happier to help and chat - working hard!\n\nFound the layout a bit confusing and all seemed a bit ‘add on’, we were given a map on arrival which helped to a degree but in reality we went where we could around other people rather than studying the map. You’re sent through the museum to get in which is a long hallway in effect into the small animal handling area - an old cow shed with multiple doors off to various things but you couldn’t really choose (it wasn’t a v busy afternoon as it was wet) and just had to go where you could with a buggy.\n\nHappy with pricing for one adult, concession and 2 x under 2. Might get pricey with older kids.\n\nSeemed like a good shop at reception but you have to walk through it to get out (as always)!",

Unfortunately the shop was closed the next day as it was a Sunday, however the cafe was open so decided to stop and have breakfast before we departed. So review on the cafe, what a lovely experience indoor and outdoor seating with kids play toys on the grass area outside. Kids review 9/10. When entering we was greeted by a very friendly girl called Laura, who took our order with a smile and also offered to bring it out to us as we took the outdoor seating for the kids to play. Not cheap, but you can see why when our order arrived, it has only the best ingredients used, I have to say one of the best breakfasts I have had and was well worth the money. sitting outside with lovely views and a very peacefull setting, very little road noise and next to a polo field. Was a pleasure to be here for the night, and for breakfast could not rate this place higher. The food was so lovely we also brought some cakes for our travels and were served but 2 equally lovely girls called Grace and Sarah. They were fantastic with the children and we Will defiantly be returning when next this way. This is also very wheelchair friendly for the people that need this access Thanks",

At the start you could see which walks were accessible and which were closed off, so we picked the longest available walk. There were no printed maps so we took a photo as reference (which as they said saved them money :) ) We enjoyed a slow walk around whilst geocaching, and found a lovely spot to enjoy a picnic too. The weather was overcast and showery so it was a pleasant quiet walk too! The walk was really well sign posted and we will definitely be back to do some more! Enjoyed an ice cream at the cafe when we got back to the car :)\nUnfortunately most my photos I took on my dslr but here are a couple I took on my phone.

All the strawberries were ripe, sweet and juicy. After that, we took a ride back to the main area where we bought tickets for the kids activity area. They had a bunch of awesome attractions and fun activities for them. By the time it was closing time, the kids still didn't want to leave, so that says it all.

I would 100% recommended trying them as they all looked great and tasted even better.\n\nAs for service, we weren’t offered any water for the table, even though everyone else had a bottle on the tables around us.

There's a big indoor animal barn as well as an area outside to walk around to see the bigger animals. There is also a tractor ride & barrel rides for the kids. Plenty of food & drink outlets with prices not too expensive. All in all a great family day out.",

Getting to feed the baby sheep was nice and also petting the gerbils , feeding the goats and seeing all the animals was lovely! Car parking on site which is handy , lots of play activities to enjoy! Nice to see the animals food was well priced at just £1 per pot! Good range of food to offer and a fairly big inside play area for the kids too! For the price I definitely recommend!! The farm isn’t too far from the train station either! About 5 mins in a car or taxi.",

Picnic area outside with benches, seating or bring a picnic blanket and chill out on the grass, taking in the beautiful surroundings. Water bowls inside/outside for our furry family members too. The farm shop is visually stunning, well stocked with produce and it makes it almost impossible for you not to purchase produce. Farm shop staff really friendly and knowledgeable about their products. Excellent place for all, we will definitely be going back. Thank you everyone.",

We think the meat was cheaper than at the farmers market so worth the drive if you buy a larger quantity. The coffee shop was excellent, breakfast meals until 12 then a lunch time menu. Range of all days meals, bacon roll for example. Bacon roll was outstanding, 3 large thick slices of flavoursome bacon in a soft roll. Childrens meals good value.\nLovely atmosphere,  busy but food only took 5 mins to arrive. Coffee good quality.\nDefinitely recommend a visit. Lambs, piglets, some goats and a forest adventure area which you need to book tickets for. Closed on my visit but will come back. Bring wellies!",

Posting this review to help others to navigate here and what is farm about. We followed Google to the entrance but there was no clear sings. Just drive down the end of the orchard and you'll find a table with prices, collection box and also signs with name of the plums and apples at each row(see photos). There will be loads of punnets and baskets for you to collect but they are £1.5 so better to bring your own. While picking we met loads of lovely locals with dogs. Then we met the son of the owner Stuart who told us more about orchard. They have different varieties of plums and apples that ripen one by one starting from July till late of Autumn. We had plums \"Victoria\", \"Yellow Eggs\", \"Avalon\", \"Pershore\", \"Greengages\". Also we had \"Discovery\" apples. You can come to the farm even outside of hours so don't be afraid to drive there even if you are not sure.\nOverall we had great experience! Lovely local PYO farm that is jus 30 min from Cambridge.",

          "text": "Small PYO farm with covered strawberry field.\n\nYou pay £2 to enter per person and then it's £5.99 per KG you pick. If you don't have a basket they will still you as many as you need for £1 each. If you buy more than £10 worth of fruit you get the basket (s) for free.\nThere is also a selection of pre pick fruit and vegetables at the shop near the gate where you pay.\n\nCASH ONLY. No cashless option.\n\nYou can do bank transfers on your phone, which is what we ended up having to do as we didn't have any cash on us.\n\nA little bit pricey for what it is, but the strawberries were very very tasty. Treat it as a novelty trip out and it's all good fun.",

I visit regularly to enjoy their delicious local produce and the extensive variety they offer.\n\nRecently, we had a great time strawberry picking 🍓. The strawberry bushes are elevated on stands, which is perfect if you prefer not to bend down while picking your fruit. A.G. Meales & Sons farm shop also provides a selection of seasonal fruits and vegetables to pick, depending on the time of year. For instance, in autumn, they have a stunning array of pumpkins available for picking.\n\nOn several occasions, we've treated ourselves to a visit to Vera's, their fantastic cafe. The food is exceptional and all made on-site. I've also savoured their delightful afternoon teas, which are truly fit for a queen 👸.\n\nThey have a beautiful selection of flowers and plants in their garden centre, along with a variety of garden tools and features.\n\nIt's a free outing for the kids to enjoy the amenities, although we often end up purchasing something because their produce is hard to resist. Dogs are welcome in the outdoor area of the farm shop, which I think is wonderful.\n\nAll the staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about everything they sell. This is my favourite farm shop, and I find immense joy even in just wandering around, admiring the beautiful plants, or enjoying a coffee at Vera's cafe.",

Fun for the kids. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because of the price of the pumpkins you pick at the end.

There was a craft fair on too at the time, which was really well managed. Lots of people and children, yet it was all set out and spaced out well, so it didn't feel crowded.\n\nWhile we were looking at the flowers, a lady came over and gave us loads of awesome advice for our gardening.\n\nFarm shop is lovely too. We picked up a few pieces from there to try, and we got some lovely plants. The young lady at the shop sorted us with a box to make it easier to carry home, as we walked there.\n\nWe took our dog along, and everywhere is dog friendly. Water bowls for the pups are available too, which is always nice to see. Everyone was very patient and welcoming.\n\nWrapped up the day with a cheeky hot dog from the stand out front and a sit at the picnic benches. Very good food!\n\nWe will definitely be back!",

Its ok, not much to do apart from pumpkin picking, have a hot drink/snack and take some photos with few props. £5 ticket for parking and activity however if your child is young then they won't be able to participate in the activities, so £5 for parking really. I purchased a pumpkin and was charged £12 , the extra large pumpkin price but to me this pumpkin was not extra large, it was medium/large. Can get a bigger pumpkin in the supermarkets for cheaper",

Queenie is such a warm, kind, and engaging person - instantly making you feel at home. She’s full of incredible stories and deep knowledge about the land, the cows, and the history of the area, and listening to her felt like chatting with an old friend.\n\nThe Highland cows were, of course, the stars of the show - so majestic and gentle, and we were even lucky enough to see a baby! Just being in their presence was special, but to see them against the stunning backdrop of the Scottish Highlands was honestly breathtaking. The scenery alone is worth the visit, but adding in the cows and the warmth of our host made it unforgettable.\n\nI left feeling full of joy and gratitude to have experienced such a unique and beautiful place.

It is well worth it though. There are so many animals to see and you can buy feed for £2 a bag. The goats are my favourite but there are so many cuties (including alpacas which are actually at a field at the end of the car park outside so if you haven't used your animal food at closing you can go up and feed them when you leave). There are multiple different play parks for kids as well as a softplay area indoors and a shooting game thing. We always pack a lunch so we don't need to stop to go in to eat and usually eat on the wee benches next to the big slides and bouncy things. There are go karts too although we've never been on them since kids are too wee right now.",

They loved it! Just be aware that some animals, (a goat in our case) are very clever, and whilst you feed another animal they grab the feed bag out of your hands 🤣 All very funny though.

I had a simple toasted coronation chicken sandwich and salad - amazing tasting coronation sauce and a fantastic dressed salad. A lovely lunch so I was recommending the place to friends for such good, simple food.\n\nBUT I return 3 weeks later, there were no toasted sandwiches on the menu under a new chef. I went for the new coronation chicken. It was completely different to the previous version, sliced chicken and very little coronation sauce, a dry ‘rub’ type of sauce, I was very disappointed. My wife also,  as no panini’s on the menu for her. We heard another customer asking where were the panini’s - they were no longer on the new menu.\n\nI can not recommend the restaurant with its new menu choices. If I had seen a photo of the meal I was going to be served I would not have ordered it.\n\nMore positively the staff were pleasant and the surroundings lovely.\n\nNot sure when I will return again to sample this current menu, a shame as this handy little restaurant is so close by to me.",

The collies are beautiful, the lady who we see around is always helpful. I've seen a review commenting on it being dirty....its a farm, don't go to a farm if you are worried about dirt. It's as clean as a working farm can be and we have never once thought otherwise. Please remember this is a farm, providing fresh product...of course it will look like a farm. I've also seen a review about the lack of paper towels and the unsatisfaction about the towel provided to clean up. I personally have never spilled anything, neither has my partner or friends when visiting. It's not hard to not be messy and it's actually nice that the woman has provided a towel for those who do make a mess. I've seen one review on the price... it's very hard to \"accidentally\" spend £20... very hard to accidentally spend money. Its very simple to operate and even has signs with very clear instructions if you do get confused. This place is a hidden gem. The products are lovely and well priced for the quality thats provided. Great wee place that is well worth the visit.",

They are a community centered farm, people can come stay and help on the farm, it's the ultimate circular economy/ecosysty. There's a farm shop based on honesty, loads of animals and I will definitely be returning in the future to stay for a little longer to allow my children time in nature. So lovely!",

The staff seemed happy but didn’t know how to serve customers properly. We didn’t have menus, so we grabbed some from another table and were told off. Our food arrived after 40 minutes with no cutlery or napkins. It was difficult to get staff attention. Also, they only gave us one napkin to share, which was disappointing since they charged over the odds for the food. Frankly, this is our first and last visit to Castleton Farm Restaurant. On the plus side, the shop is reasonably good and reasonably priced, but the poor customer service is an absolute letdown. ☹️",

The owner is a mine of helpful information, and most of the fresh vegetables seem to be grown by her. The provenance of pretty much everything else is well known to her, and the fridges and shelves are full of exciting goodies. Aside from local produce by the shelf-load, there are plenty of non-perishable delicacies (olive oils, cordials, jams, pasta etc.). We are on holiday in the area and have been in four times in the last week! We've had little need to look for the usual big supermarkets, being lucky enough to be staying in the vicinity of this shop, and it's open 6 days a week.  Among many things we found artisan cheeses, fresh bread, peas in the pod, Swiss chard, earth-covered potatoes, local dairy products, vine-ripe tomatoes, sausages, and even buffalo meat from Kircaldy! This type of shop is something all local food producers would be lucky to have nearby. The owner is a passionate advocate for and provider of the best locally farmed and produced goods that this part of Scotland has to offer. Oh, and you can pay by card - Brilliant!",

We’ve been loyal customers for years, living just a short walk away, but the prices have skyrocketed while the quality has declined.

To top it off, a bacon roll costs £5, which is equally outrageous. Enough is enough; we won’t be returning.",

I arrived via the back entrance by mistake, which meant a lovely drive through the berry fields — it brought back fond memories of picking strawberries and raspberries during school holidays to earn money for new school uniforms.\n\nThe farm shop itself is spacious, well-stocked, and full of fantastic local produce. I was thrilled to find Stornoway black pudding by Charles Macleod — exactly what I was hoping to take back with me to Thailand. I also picked up some beautiful strawberries and a delicious Highland brie.\n\nThe attached bistro looked very inviting too, with a great selection of coffees, teas, and home baking on offer.

You likely don’t want to do a weekly shop here but £30 on some treats or unique items to try is nice.\n\nLady on the till was very patient & friendly in explaining our lamb experience & to other customers.\n\nWe had an appointment little time to wander the farm & see pigs, chickens, goats & llamas before a group of around 14 had the rules explained to them & taken into a pen. We were given bottles of milk with corresponding numbers marked on 2wk old lambs.\n\nHad so much time with them which was really lovely to watch them enthusiastically jump & bleat, be fed, cuddle & take photos and chat to the amazing farmer. He is so friendly & funny and great with the young kids too.\n\nWe could see the 2day old lambs with their mums in the next pen.\n\nFacilities to wash hands afterwards.\nLearning about his work, the orphaned lambs and cuddles was a superb experience to see how hard the farmers work and the cycle of life.",

It has great views of the coastline and is just a short walk to the beach. We used bikes to get around and the roads were quiet, allowing us to enjoy the surrounding countryside.\n\nThank you to Rob and Vicky for your hospitality and good luck with the ongoing project, we are looking forward to returning next year!",

They have a washing machine to which is huge and again run of honesty box.\n\nI really loved the pizza oven they have here and I actually made some pizzas to. Pop some wood in and give this a try and make some fun memories.\n\nThe kitchen had a microwave and air fryer and all the utensils you need. Along with a huge fridge and a separate fridge and freezer.\n\nThe communal space is brilliant with a dining area and a lounge which you can pop some logs on the fire if you wish to.\n\nLove the chicken which roam freely which I bonded with along with the pet cat. Honestly there nothing not to like about this place, it feels like home.\n\nI could quite easily sell up shop so to speak and go and live here it's amazing. The beach is a stroll away along with a brilliant restaurant and shops locally.\n\nThe guys who run this place are so nice and friendly they should be so proud of there development its beautiful just like them!",

Thank you, Rob! The communal cooking and seating areas gave us opportunities to meet, chat and share experiences with some lovely people. We also appreciated the cleanliness and tidiness, as well as all the plants, birds and natural materials which provide interest and a feeling of being constantly close to nature. The atmosphere that Rob and Vicky have created is homely and, on the whole, their guests respond very positively to this. The fledging starling family was a constant source of delight.

It is spacious with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms (offering the option of both a shower and a bath), a large kitchen, with plenty of utensils and saucepans, etc, with table and sofa and a good sized living room also with a table.  Handy utility room with washing mchine and tumble drier. Plenty of room for a family to spread out. We found it very peaceful and the beds were very comfortable. Books and games are provided.  There is a wood burning stove in the living room for you to use but the cottage is very warm and we couldn't have had the stove going too!  Around the cottage you will find paintings and ceramics all done by the highly talented landlord, we bought a couple of the ceramic birds. There is parking next to the cottage for one car.  Views are superb over Voe pier and bay. Wifi is provided and is good, phone signal, as in all areas of Shetland, is hit or miss, I found making the odd call that I needed to make through Whatsapp worked perfectly.  There is a bakery next door that you can get your fresh bread, rolls, pies, etc, from.  Coop is around 10 minutes drive away in Brae.  Also in Brae is Frankie's Fish and Chip Shop and a Chinese Takeaway, can recommend both! It was a great location for exploring from and I would definitely stay here again.",

When you taste the chocolate, it tastes like a mouse texture and not too rich. Lovely. She also had the non dairy vanilla, too. We had the privilege to try it first as he only done the chocolate for the first time, and I would definitely recommend it. They also lemon and Lime sorbet. Staff are very helpful and service top.",

We would highly recommend this place.",

The tours were run very efficiently and they were happy to answer all of our questions. I toured in May and there were lots of babies curious about our visit. The website made it seem like a very easy commute from Edinburgh, so if you are a tourist, know that is not really the case, but it is worth it. It is about a 1 1/2 hour scenic train ride and then you either take a taxi (about 50 pounds) directly to the farm or catch a bus to the closest town. If you are touring the cities but want a glimpse of the countryside, this is a great way to spend an afternoon up close to the farm animals. We were able to get pretty close to the highland cows and then could walk the farm to see a lot of the other animals they have also, after the tour. Thanks for a memorable afternoon!",

I truly never imagined being able to get so \"up close and personal\" with these adorable animals.  The calves were very curious, and one was so comfortable, that he laid down among us, for scratches and cuddles!  Fenwick was quick to answer a lot of questions about the herd, and very proud. The feeding interaction with goats, pigs, sheep, and Highland cows was also a lot of fun.....even for adults.  The ram was scary beautiful....those eyes!!  Keep doing what you are doing!!",

Haven’t stopped talking about it since , we booked the deluxe experience for my dads birthday as he is a huge fan of highland cows and it did not disappoint ! Richard was amazing and answered every question we and my highland cow mad dad had , which showed his extensive knowledge and care and love for the fold and his job ! Nugget was the star of the show and was so affectionate , even coming over for a fuss and a neck scratch and enjoying a moment with Richard ! We expected to groom them but for a calf to allow us so close and to enjoy it was a truly special experience!\n\nCouldn’t reccomend more ! Also on nice days like the day we came I thought it was so lovely to be able to go out to them in the field and groom them in their own environment rather than in a barn as the cows were loving a graze in their natural environment and a nice groom to scratch their backs and it felt much less “manufactured” than other highland cow experiences !",

Both times were delightful and I look forward to visiting again. The farm covers a beach, a railway bridge, and acres of sometimes step hillside and looks after loads of animals. Our favourite were the llamas and the cows. We even saw wild pine martens in the evening! The lodges have wee balconies and big windows so you can watch the many birds that come to the birdfeeders or the amazing views across Loch Carron. Up at the farm you're high enough above the water to be able to mostly avoid the midges. The lodges themselves are well-stocked with kitchenware, towels, & linens. They are clean & comfortable, and provide heaters so are very easy to warm when needed.\n\nDon't be concerned by the peat coloured tap water it is perfectly potable and pretty normal in these parts. It's one of many ways that the farm is self-sufficient - you can also buy plenty of eggs on site. I really cannot compliment Craig Highland Farm enough, it's a true haven in a beautiful part of Wester Ross and if peace, trains, nature & wildlife is what you're after then this is the spot!",

          "text": "Unfortunately we were quite disappointed with our visit. We were directed to the barn after paying £3pp and £1 for food. Inside the barn were pigs (you couldn't pet), 1 rabbit, 1 chicken with chicks and some goats which only 3 you could pet. No staff around so no chance to hold the goats. We were only there for 15 minutes. Website incorrectly says £1.50 each; that would be a fairer price, felt I had been ripped off at £3 each.\nWe bought some milk and burgers in the farm shop. Burgers were amazing. Was super happy to be able to buy gluten free burgers. £7 for 4 (500g) and they were very meaty, no fat/water came off when cooking. Would buy again.",

The cabin was perfect and had everything we needed. Loved watching the wallabies, emus and meeting the water buffalo, goats and rabbits. Would definitely recommend!",

There were rabbits, emus, buffalo, wallabies, pigs, goats, and hens. The kids loved petting the rabbits and having them on their laps.\n\nYou can also purchase a range of products from the shop, from buffalo sausages and steaks, to honey and apple juice. All of which is sourced from the farm itself.\n\nThere are now a few lodges on the farm that you can stay in too, with access to a fun climbing frame and trampoline.",

Primrose Cabin was just right for us. Both the cabins and play area are safe and enclosed so perfect for toddlers on the go 😂. It was great just listening to all the aimals and farm noises and its the best sleep, I've had in a while!. The views include wallabies from one window, goats and hens from another and the peacocks popping up to keep us on our toes. They are definitely\nthe bosses on the farm!. James's best bit was the homemade ice cream and the animals. The Highland Burgers were amazing washed down with their own apple juice too. We will be back and next time will book a farm tour. You have done an amazing job. Looking forward to what's to come!💜",

Think after my second visit ill be giving it a wide berth from now on. Pricing a bit high for what you get, coffee average. Plenty of parking and outside seating.",

We asked how much it was for outside play and the waiter said just to go ahead for free so maybe when you dine there they let you outside for free. I agree with some other reviews about broken seats on the go karts and the stone ground isn't good for the karts also. The new indoor play area seems good for the kids with a big bouncy castle, 2 pool tables and a soccer table also. They have added outdoor seating now and a small bouncy castle just beside the seating. Plenty of farm animals to go and see.",

Many of the soap dispensers were out of soap and they have lots of hand washing stations\n3. The train ride was listed as 30mins on the website but only lasted 15mins.  It isn’t circular, it goes along the track, engine turns and then you go back\n3.  The cafe was quite good - look out for the specials menu though as we never seen it tucked on the side wall until leaving.  They forgot our salad that was listed on menu but they quickly rectified this.\n4. There are no prices displayed for any of the drinks or ice creams.\n5.  If you have an EV forget about using their charger - it’s is a slow charger with a £1.50 connection charge and a maximum stay of 1hr before a £10 overstay charge occurs; I recon you might be able to get 5/6%.\n\nThe museum was informative and interesting to look at.  Once you go outdoors however you can see poor maintenance and condition of a lot of things unfortunately.\n\nTractor drive was something to do.  Only takes you along passed the horses and back again.\n\nTrain journey doesn’t take you past any of the animals.\n\nPlay park area is good for the kids but very little shade for a sunny day.",

We were carrying our very elderly 3 kilo Maltese dog and were stalked by a member of staff and rudely ‘thrown out’. It was made clear to us that the resident cat population in the garden centre means dogs are strictly not permitted, whether being carried or not. We had absolutely no intention of putting our dog on the ground and were shocked by the policy being so unbending and by the extremely rude manner of the staff member.\n\nWe will never be back to this garden centre which is a pity. The choice of plants and sculptures is wonderful, but unless it is cool enough to leave your dog in your car, or your dog is large enough to be tied up outside, l would recommend avoiding New Hopetoun Garden Centre and instead take your business to one of the many garden centres that do welcome well behaved pets.",

There is a small shop which sells snacks, coffee, cold drinks, ice cream, etc. and bags of feed for the goats, sheep and pigs. All the animals were curious and happy to be petted (for food of course). The very cute Alpacas were shy but just looking at them close up was a treat. And getting close to a Highland Coo was a rare treat. The variety of cute animals, chickens, ducks and a turkey kept us four adults and an 11-year old entertained for a couple of hours. The owners are very responsible on hygiene with clear instructions and a sink and soap next to the shop to wash hands during and after petting. It’s a fun day out and highly recommended.",

From the moment we arrived, the warmth and friendliness of the staff made us feel genuinely welcome—like visiting an old friend rather than booking a tour.\n\nThe highlight, without a doubt, was the one-hour guided tour led by owner Richard, whose depth of knowledge about deer and local wildlife was nothing short of captivating. His storytelling, paired with the tranquil beauty of animals in their natural habitat, kept us so engaged that the hour flew by in what felt like minutes.\n\nWhether you’re a wildlife enthusiast, a curious visitor, or just looking for a serene outing, this park delivers in spades. We left feeling enriched and inspired—and will absolutely be returning.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Highly recommended!",

Inside the store there's a little bit of everything. There are fresh raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries, both fresh and frozen. As well as a fridge with cakes, tray bakes, and cheesecakes. The shop also offers a variety of produce from the farm as well as local producers. The smell of honey is dreamlike. The staff is fun and polite. It's a great experience!",

There is a lovely garden tearoom, a  big pond full of birdlife and and an adjacent animal sanctuary with separate  entry which is only £2 extra. Very reasonable in this greedy age. Here you will find  Alpacas, Llamas, beautiful horses and ponies. You can feed pigs.Pet Guinea pigs.Kids will love it. There is ample parking close to the tearoom. Staff were all helpful and friendly.Its a great day out.",

This place offers so much more than Tesco in my opinion. And a wider selection. Some of their items are cheaper too! And so much more selection on flowers 💐 if ur a bit of a gardener. I highly recommend this place. Oh and soo much more points here too. if u love ur Clubcard, well Morrisons do a lot more points here ie £5 gives u 5000 pints whereas Tesco it’s like 5 pints for every pound?",

          "text": "I am expressing my concern regarding the lack of organisation I have observed at my local Morrisons store in recent weeks, specifically concerning the fresh \"Make Your Own Pizza\" counter. My daughter particularly enjoys this service, which is advertised as being available from store opening until 7:00 PM. However, I have repeatedly encountered the counter either completely unmanned until staff are specifically requested, or closed entirely without any prior notice to customers. This has resulted in unnecessary waiting and confusion for shoppers. When I enquired about the situation, staff appeared unsure of the expected procedures and simply stated that the counter was closed, without offering further explanation. This inconsistency is disappointing and does not reflect the level of service one expects. I strongly suggest that, if the operational hours of the counter have changed, the signage should be updated accordingly to prevent further inconvenience. I hope you will address this issue promptly to improve the customer experience.",

It's rows of blueberry bushes that are loaded. My kids and I were in heaven! So don't wear high heels mmk?\n\nThinking of going back before blueberry season ends! Then.... Blackberries!

Great that it's dog friendly too, a corn maze to run around and have fun in and making your way through a  pumpkin patch to hunt for the best pumpkins.\nHowever the only thing I did not understand is why the tickets were £10 to park your car, and then she'll put quite a bit of money as the largest pumpkins were £10-15, it was a lovely time on the farm, but I do think one decent sized pumpkin around have been included in the ticket payment and then if we wanted others I think fair to pay extra for them. It was a great set up but we did drive quite far to come out to this farm and it doesn't say on the website pumpkins weren't included in the price, you should make people aware exactly what they're paying for at least.",

The surface is good but for a self propelled wheelchair it may prove a challenge. Certainly my son could not have managed it without assistance. That said, everything else was smooth and flat and there were ramps and lifts where required.\n\nMy son has already advised he would like to go back.\n\nFor families with children who love the play centres or soft play there were loads of options which would likely make the visit a longer one. There did not seem to be much of the play facilities that would have suited a wheelchair user; however, we went for the animals so this was not an issue for us.\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our time there and will hopefully return for some of the events in the future.",

But in fairness the children didn't ask anyway as were pre occupied with everything else and we weren't outside when it was running. We loved the inside bit where you could pet the animals on the tables, and the indoor play structures were great. Outdoor bits also great fun and plenty of animals to see.

          "text": "We had a great day out here, got here early for around half 10 (booked online which was easy enough with a lot of available slots) and stayed until the last thing on the timetable which if I remember correctly was petting and feeding the rabbits their dinner before closing for the day, my 3 year old loved that! We did watch Lottie the cow being milked, I did think all of us would get the chance to actually milk the cow but I think I just assumed wrong! It was still entertaining and educational for the older kids…My daughter is called Lottie so it was funny the cow had the same name. Petting the rabbits, Guinea pigs and tortious was fun, be good if there were a few more for visitors to pet as it felt you were mainly watching others petting, my daughter loved the petting she got to do. The tractor ride and the cafe prices are the main reason for the 4 star rather than 5. The tractor ride was fun for my 3 year old as she is easily entertained but I noticed there wasn’t much to actually look it and a lot of pens were empty which is disappointing as the long wait to go on it two times add up, it’s best to go to the ride ahead of time to avoid not getting on the first ride around otherwise you’ll have to wait another 10-15 minutes, not a big deal if your kids are playing/distracted but if they’re tired or impatient then make sure you get there early. The cafe was very pricey and they didn’t do hot food by the time I went in there so I bought a muffin and a piece of fruit which I felt like I needed to take out a mortgage to afford. The sand box play area and the play area with the little tike cars and tractors was very fun and that kept my toddler entertained for ages, including the big tractor with the slide. We did do the walk around the lake but didn’t see any fish, the camp fire area must be good if they do event nights for scout clubs ect, that could bring in some money for the farm! We really did enjoy our day and I think the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. The kind lady that worked in the gift shop was helpful when it came to me asking plenty of questions about the yearly membership and the mum group that happens on Tuesdays. Unfortunately I moved so I won’t return for a while but I hope to visit again one day! Recommend others going and doing a few round trips on the day with animal food to prolong the stay to make the entry fee worth it.",

The barrel rides, the raptor slide, panning for gold and pedal carts were all great additions. we spent a full day at the farm and took our own picnic. The highlight was the pig racing, great fun! We ended the day with the 'Summer fiesta' party which the kids absolutely loved. The staff were all fantastic, full of enthusiasm and everyone was so helpful and friendly. Id highly recommend a trip to Manorafon Farm to anyone visiting North Wales.",

The farm shop has great locally produced items, including food, drink, pet foods, toiletries, gifts etc. Im in love with their filter coffee, but the star of the food show (for me) is the Lentil Burger! It's filling and tastes delicious. It's great to see a farm offering plant-based food for those of us who don't eat meat. (Check with staff regarding the green sauce/brioche bun if you don't consume dairy) I hope to see a few more plant-based items appearing on the shelves in the future 😉 The ultimate star of the show is indeed their Bison herd  They are beautifully majestic & where else do you get to see them in the UK? Take a wander on the bison walk, and hopefully, you'll get to see them up close. (The viewing platform is a nice touch!) 🦬🦬🦬🦬🦬 🦬",

They were all absolutely delicious! But I would give a special mention to my veggie one. They are often dry and like an afterthought on the menu. This wasn't! Crispy and well cooked patty on the outside and beautiful vibrant and moist veggie galore in the inside. Delicious! All the burger buns, chips and sauces were really beautiful, too.\nThe shop itself was a bit on the expensive side, but then 🤷🏼‍♀️ Rhug is also a working farm, so as a bonus we saw some bisons while we walked about a bit..There is a proper farm walk, but we weren't prepared for that this time, so we will go back 🙂\nMy 5 stars is definitely for the food and atmosphere.

Like us, they were mostly pensioners or small families, but the incredibly rude staff member seems to rejoice in humiliating people. I have seen older customers treated so disrespectfully, and in such a loud manner, that it amounts to bullying. I think it's time the manager spoke to this man, as he openly declares his dislike of the job. This, together with long wait times, consistently incorrect orders and poor food quality means we won't be returning in the future. This man has humiliated us once to many times.",

Fishing in the beautiful pools was also a real treat.\n\nCannot wait to get back here! Thank you Tarvin Sands for an amazing break! You're all awesome 😊",

Sadly, it’s closed Sunday–Wednesday, so we couldn’t pop back straight away—but that just gives us the perfect excuse to return! The staff are friendly, the butchers are knowledgeable, and the whole shop has such a warm, welcoming ambience. The homemade produce is to die for—scotch eggs and pork pie heaven! We’ll be heading over Wednesday morning for more of their amazing Denver steak and flavoured sausage , and no doubt calling in again on the way home. Can’t wait!",

If you're a young toddler parent at under 3s it's even more worth the price but I would still come if he was over 3 because this is such a fun outdoor and indoor experience at such a good price. There is so much to do and you definitely need the full day. We're currently still here but it already deserves my review. So far my toddler has played on the outdoor playground the jumping balloons and the indoor soft play which may I add is brilliant, it's so big and clean given it's on a farm! The layout is great better than any soft play that's open all year round. Really wish they would stay open all year round and make something suitable for all seasons because this is such a fun place to be. I called before hand and the man who picked up the phone was also ever so friendly and informative. We will be back! Wish we got a season ticket.",

The pumpkins were great, the barn was brilliant with all the arts and crafts. The kids throughly enjoyed. The reason I have 4 stars was because the burger van was way over priced and the burgers were tiny. It cost £7 for a small cheese burger for the kids and it had one small burger, 1 slice of cheese and 1 slice of small bacon when it was meant to he a bacon stack burger. It cost us £14 for 2 burgers smaller than a rustler, thought it would have come with chips and a drink for the price and being for kids. We will come again but won't be using the burger van.",

Most of the wash stations didn't work properly, need better play areas for kids and it's expensive for what it is. Extra charges for animal encounters, animal feed should be £1. Foam party was cool, kids enjoyed that, but as it was at 4pm, we had to wait along time as you will go around the park in 2hrs max, should bring it forward a bit. If you haven't been then it's a decent day out with kids, but doesn't have repeat visit appeal.",

Even as you walk in towards reception you already get to see some gorgeous peacocks and ducks.\n\nFriendly greeting at reception and easy sign in.\nWe were handed our animal feed (purchased in advance with our tickets) and explained the rules very clearly.\n\nWe stopped for a snack first at one of their picnic tables and then proceeded through the park.\nAmazing animals right as you start with information about them on a poster by the enclosure.\nWe were extremely lucky to have been there at feeding time and we got to see one of the volunteers feed the meerkats and he even took the time to tell us about their personalities and behaviour. It was amazing to see the animals up close and being cared for so nicely.\n\nAs we carried on, we got to see some animals we don’t usually see in these farms, like a Kookaburra and a skunk. Continued on towards the goats who were hungry fellas and very gentle, my child had a great time feeding them. We then headed towards the llamas and alpacas who were also very gentle and easy to feed, it was a fantastic experience.\n\nThroughout our visit we got to see swans, ducks, horses, lemurs, capybaras and even wallabies! One of the wallabies had a baby in their pouch! So cute!!\n\nFoam party at 4pm by the reception which all the kids seemed to be having a blast with!\n\nI’ll also mention that there’s a lovely play area for smaller children with a sand pit and some little houses.\n\nThere were hand washing stations all throughout so you could consistently wash your hands after interacting with the animals. If I have one small note, it would be that a few of them had run out of soap but that wasn’t that big of an issue as there was always another one nearby. We’ll just bring some hand sanitiser next time, no biggie.\n\nWe didn’t sign up for the animal interaction this time - they have goats, bunnies, Guinea pigs and tortoises - but we will for sure go for it next time.\n\nAll in all, it was a brilliant time, there is something for everybody there. You can see the animals are well taken care of and they all looked very relaxed. The staff/volunteers are incredibly nice and more than one took the time to have a chat with us about the animals.\n\nWill definitely be visiting again.",

Taking your time to enjoy everything you can easily spend the full day. Seems the whole place is really made for the animals. Staff are really knowledgeable and friendly. My only down side is we were let to believe the reptile meet and greet to be more interactive, felt a bit, misleading. It's a extra show room to view reptiles and insects.

The hosts couldn’t do enough for us, they met us when we arrived to take us to our tent in there Land Rover, they made sure the hot tub was heated up ready and lit the fire inside the tent for us so it was warm. Provided us with more than enough wood for the fire. Gave us an extra light and some batteries for the lights inside the tent. We had delicious fresh pizza’s delivered to us on the evening and a breakfast hamper brought to us in the morning. Such lovely peaceful surroundings, done some stargazing by the fire pit and listened out for the owls and foxes. Very cosy, loved that there were lots of blankets and a hot water bottle. Was warm enough, even in December. One thing I’d add is a little bin, there isn’t one in the tent, we like to be respectful and not leave a mess. Would definitely return again with our two young girls in the summer. Thanks Tog Farm for a lovely stay :)",

Lots of great animals on the farm too, some rare breeds you aren’t likely to find at similar places. Also situated in close proximity to Cardiff and Caerphilly if you fancy something more urban.  Highly recommended.",

From the moment I booked to the minute I left, I was greeted with excellent customer service and fantastic communication. When first booking, I highlighted that this was a trip for my girlfriend’s birthday and the host was incredible. She went above and beyond decorating the pitch with balloons and banners, as well as organising a birthday cake. The host was attentive in ensuring we had everything we needed and ensuring everything was in place before our arrival. When we arrived, we were greeted by a host who was welcoming and helpful. Due to the weather conditions, she provided us with a lift down to the field and on our return. Facilities provided were clean. Additional duvets were provided due to the cold weather. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at Tog Farm and look forward to planning our next visit.",

The warm drinks were a perfect touch on a chilly day, but the highlight was undoubtedly the magical winter wonderland they had created. It was like stepping into a festive dream! So much thought & effort has gone into this.\n\nWe can’t wait to return next year.

It wasn't a  big garden centre but there was a good choice of plants at good prices.\nThe tearoom was lovely- food and drinks were on a par with most places pricewise. We had drinks and cake which we enjoyed. It was clean and tidy, staff were friendly and there was a lovely view- particularly if sat outside.\nThere was an ice cream parlour too but we didn't try it.\nPlenty of parking.\nWill definitely visit again.",

I was trying my best to do that without being issued a parking ticket. One size doesn’t fit all. Sometimes you just need to talk to a person!",

While finishing my purchase, a shop assistant came over and asked whether I had paid for the shopping bag I was using. I explained that I had already bought the bag the evening before and regularly use reusable bags.\n\nWhat made the situation worse was that a second staff member came and questioned me again, even checking my bill in front of others. It felt humiliating and made me feel like I was being accused of something dishonest.\n\nI asked them to check the CCTV footage to verify my explanation, but they showed no interest and offered apology for the way I was treated.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve been put in such an uncomfortable position while simply doing my shopping. I expected better treatment, especially when trying to be environmentally conscious by reusing bags. The staff could have handled the situation much more professionally and discreetly. Very disappointing.",

Although I didn't have an appetite for soup I figured that because it's M&S it should be nice. Mistake! Tomato and basil, it was so bland and had lumps in it! I've had better canned tomatoe soup from Lidl! The hot chocolate cost over £4 and the picture looked amazing, tall cup with loads of squirty cream and chocolate dust, when it came, the cream was flat with a stupid swirl of what was probably meant to look like a chocolate pattern! Greggs hot chocolate is half the price and way better.. Onto the cakes. After all my disappointment with the soup and chocolate I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt, their cakes MUST be nice, this is M&S! 😂 Where does M&S get off charging nearly £4 for a smidgen of a slice of lemon drizzle cake that is a weak excuse for one of the best cakes on the planet?\n\nIn summary\n\nOverpriced nasty food. I won't be going there again.\n\nThis is not just food! this is not food at all actually!! Shame on you M&S, what happened to your quality?",

This was way too noisy for me.  High ceilng, no soft   furnishing or curtains, to dampen the general chatter and general cafe noise.\nIt is overwhelming for me.\nI  was sad that I had to walk away.

From the minute you arrive you are made to feel welcome. Being able to be in amongst the reindeer and hand feed them and stroke them was magical. This family run experience is amazing, I learnt so much about the reindeer and was lovely to see their different personalities. Whether you adopt, have a reindeer experience at Christmas, just visit to buy a tree or have a hot chocolate, you won’t be disappointed. This is more than a 5 star experience run by a lovely family and equally as lovely helpers. Attention to detail, friendly welcome and amazing hot chocolate, cake and huge marshmallows to toast on an open fire, do not miss this opportunity! Adults and children alike will have an amazing time!",

Getting up close and personal with the reindeer was a highlight of our stay, and staying overnight in one of their cabins, specifically the Cedar Lodge, was an absolute delight. The cabins are equipped with everything you could possibly need; it truly felt like a home away from home. We particularly appreciated the comfortable memory foam mattress and the full-sized shower with amazing water pressure. The attention to detail throughout the entire property, from the cabins to the outdoor spaces, is impeccable and speaks volumes about the passion and care the family puts into running the farm. As animal lovers, we were thrilled to learn about the reindeer during our visit and even had the opportunity to meet them up close. The level of care and love given to the animals here is truly remarkable. Whether you're seeking a weekend getaway or just a night of relaxation, I wholeheartedly recommend North Hills Farm. It's an experience that will leave you with cherished memories and a desire to return.",

Sat finished for quite some time, had to go to welcome desk and collect menus ourselves for desserts. Staff were either talking amongst themselves or no where to be seen. Interrupted them chatting to place our desserts order. Desserts arrived, again drinks after. To our uncleared table. 1 dessert was smeared on the bottom side of the plate, the waitress wiped it with a napkin instead of taking back for a clean plate. Had to clear the table ourselves onto the table beside - as 1 Staff took her break and another stood chatting away to her. With multiple tables left uncleared. Not even a thank you when payment was made. Really disappointing. Won't be returning and definitely telling others not to waste there time.",

I always go to Menarys to see their Christmas decorations and was pleasantly surprised that they had a sale on so came away with a few stand alone ones and a hot water bottle. There is a lot of merchandise for such a small space which was evident when they were unboxing products.\nWe stopped in at the cafe. You have to stand at the front to be seated. Lovely staff who kindly assisted my mum as she has walking aids. Loved my toastie and my mum must have loved her all day fry judging by the empty plate. It got really busy around 12.30 so I can understand the suggested 1 hour table stay. Quite a variety of food beverages and treat choices although charging 40p for a small soya serving of milk with my tea was a little excessive. Might look for a compromise there?\nClean throughout and would recommend a visit if you were in the area.",

If your happy to queue for 25 minutes plus watching staff running around aimlessly with at least 15 cleared tables then this is for you. Told to go to table and look from menu and order from the counter which involves another 20 minutes queue to order. Food came and to be honest it was poor. Asked girl for ketchup and wad told it up at a table even though she was walking past. Several people around where unhappy with food and the queuing. It's poor for elderly people / disabled to have to stand or sit waiting. Table displays you must vacate table within an hour.

There was an impressive amount sunflowers, but don't be expecting anything spectacular.\n\nBefore we went to see the sunflowers we went into the cafe for some lunch. I had the angus burger with cheese, relish and crispy onions. My wife had a chicken wrap. We also shared a side of chips. My kids had sausages and french friesand chicken goujons and french fries.\n\nTo start with the kids meals came out 15-20 mins before our meals came out which i wasnt impressed with. I was a bit disappointed that the sausages weren't from the meat counter, but rather looked like just your standard sausage you get in any other cafe for a kids meal. Kids meals did come with a drink of juice and an ice cream (which choice of toppings and sauce). Kids were happy enough with their meals and portions were big enough.\n\nWhen mine and my wifes meals did finally come out they had a measly side garnish of pretty pathetic lettuce and half a cherry tomato dirzzled in a salad dressing. There was no apology for the delay or even an acknowledgement that we had been sitting so long without food. The place wasnt busy and always had free tables, but there was a steady stream of people coming and going. My burger looked like a half assed attempt at a smash burger which about a third of it over cooked because it was so thin. The meat didn't taste like it eas great quality and it left a funny after taste in the mouth. My wife was happy with with her wrap saying it was nice and had plenty of filling. The chips were burnt and possibly recooked looking at them, but i like them like that so no complaints from me there. We also had a coke and coke zero, with the bills coming to almost £40.\n\nI will say the staff were fairly pleasant when speaking to them, and never seemed to flustered at any stage we were there.\n\nAll in all, I was happy to go and support the air ambulance, but dont be expecting too much from the sunflower maze (there were 3 or 4 games scattered throughout the maze for the kids to play e.g. ring toss and giant jenga).\n\nI would not be back in the cafe again if that's the quality of food that they are serving.",

To avail of quad rides and animal feed it will set you back a further few pound.\n\nThe facilities were great, in terms of seeing animals (although not too many, but definitely enough), petting the dogs, bouncy castles, ride on go carts and tractors were all great. There was a great soft play area indoors that catered for most kids ages.\n\nThe outdoor play park was also great and the kids thoroughly enjoyed it, however this is weather dependant and I wouldn't recommend attending here on a wet day if you want to get your full money worth. Very scenic in the sunshine and you could spend the entire day here if you wish.\n\nThe food here is also very expensive for what you get, I. E. A family basket is 5 nuggets, 6 cocktail sausages, chips and a jug of juice. £2.50 for a 500ml bottle of coke and £2 for a fruit shoot. Again not really worth it, however you can bring your own picnics, which given what you pay for entry I would highly recommend.\n\nOverall a very good day out if the weather is right and you can spend the whole day here. However be prepared for the price.",

So when I was looking for a last minute place to get married I instantly thought of this spot. The owners don’t normally hold weddings here but they made an exception for my intimate family gathering. THANK YOU! It was absolutely gorgeous and my photographer could not shut up about how beautiful the photos were gonna turn out with the sun peaking through the weeping willow branches. Another photographer came down after to take photos of other people. It is quite the location!\nShout out to Chris, Maria, Lisa and Kyle for making this possible and for helping me put together the cutest favors for my guests! We got little maple syrup jars and Mack’s made jams that everyone was very excited to receive. Thank you for being a staple in this town and being apart of the best day of my life! 💜 Jessica",

Here's why - plenty of activities all spread out with plenty of parking, the largest selection of pumpkins, gourds, and apples that I have ever seen - ever color, shape, size, etc. Blown away! They have tons of gift shop items. The apple cider donuts were hot, fresh, and the best ever! You can get a sack of them, unfortunately not individually. They have an ice cream shack with the most flavors and add-ons I've ever seen. I would have loved to try the apple cider Sundae or maple creamee, next time! The fresh apple cider was great, and we sipped on it while we did the U-pick. Our little Halloween bucket was $15 I think. The pumpkin house in the field and hay bale maze were adorable, and they had the largest blow up pumpkin I've ever seen! Check the photos for a list of what is at the three stations. Heads up, while they have portable toilets, they have a real and clean bathroom inside to the right of the ice cream area. I got a fresh whoopie pie to try, and it was great! All staff were friendly and helpful! (Was very crowded, but it was no problem in my opinion)",

Has friendly staff available to help if you require where to get items you want. I have been using this shop since it first opened, especially with my mobility and my late mothers. Recently, I have been in because of a friend living in the area. Definitely would highly recommend this shopping centre to other individuals it is extremely near to various other shops that cater to a variety of items. It is also local to nearby hotels, which, in my opinion, is extremely helpful to tourists, our family visiting their loved one's here in my hometown,Derry Northern Ireland x ⚘️ 🌎 🇮🇪 🙏 ❤️",
